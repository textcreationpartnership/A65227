            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I had attempted the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering more than one of thoſe Pamphlets, but I found that at every turn I met with that miſtake in the Authors: who either through Ignorance or
<pb facs="tcp:55049:3"/>Deſign or both, argue for the <hi>King</hi>'s Prerogative from whatever they find to have been done in Great Councils of the Realm, or in Ordinary Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: this one miſtake, together with ſome raſh and unwarranted expreſſions glean'd out of a few, late Writers, will be found to be the main ſtrength of their Cauſe. I thought therefore that it might be a work of ſome uſe, eſpecially at this time, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the removal of this rubbiſh, and the laying open in ſome meaſure the nature of the <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juriſdiction of the Crown of England:</hi> both becauſe we have lately ſeen how dangerous and fatal theſe miſtakes are, and becauſe although much has been written ſince the Reformation by Mr. <hi>Prynn,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi> and others, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy</hi> from <hi>Forein</hi> Pretenſions and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations, yet I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any has yet taken in hand to give an Account of it, as ſtands <hi>by Law here at home.</hi> I do therefore offer theſe few Obſervations upon it to the publick, deſiring the Judicious Reader's pardon for what ſlips and imperfections he may find herein; and have added in an <hi>Appendix</hi> an Anſwer to a Section in the Book concerning <hi>Viſitatorial Power;</hi> wherein I hope the Reader will be ſatisfied how groundleſs and weak moſt of the arguments are, which our <hi>Prerogative-mongers</hi> pretend to draw from <hi>Antiquity.</hi> Theſe following Obſervations are brought down no lower then to the latter end of King <hi>Henry the eighth</hi>'s Reign.

            <p>IT is obvious enough to judicious and intelligent Perſons, by what unhappy Circumſtances it comes to paſs, that one great Mean of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation ſeems at preſent in a manner <hi>hid from our Eyes.</hi> But ſince <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>Miſtreſs of Fools,</hi> it is hoped that <hi>at leaſt in this our Day we may ſee the things that belong to our Peace;</hi>

<note place="margin">Job 39.13, 14, 15, 17.</note> forgetting that the Foot may cruſh them, is, becauſe God hath deprived her of Wiſdom, neither hath he imparted to her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>

               <hi>that the King may take what Cauſes he pleaſes to determin, from the Determination of the Judges, and determin them himſelf; and that it is clear in Divinity, that ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority belongs to the King by the Word of God.</hi> But as we are not to receive even the Word of God it ſelf, <hi>under the Sanction of a Human Law,</hi> from the Mouth of an <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> or from the whole Body of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> much leſs are we bound to ſubmit to any Courtly Gloſſes upon that Sacred Text, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power of Kings; whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as we ſuppoſe it to be grounded wholly upon Municipal Laws, ſo we know the Law to be a better Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a better Security, than any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Authority pretended from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55049:6"/>naturally ſends us back to Antiquity, to enquire how the <hi>Supremacy</hi> was then managed and exerted, before a <hi>Forreign Power</hi> had made inroads upon it. They that affirm this or the other <hi>Act</hi> to be but <hi>Declarative,</hi> and that this or that may be done by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> always al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (if they intend to perſwade) ſome Judicial or other Preſident, ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord or other, ſome anciently received Maxime or Rule of Law: They that <hi>reſolve</hi> without ſuch grounds for their Reſolution, ſet up for <hi>Law-makers</hi> and not <hi>Interpreters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it was to difficult matter to reſolve that the <hi>Supreme Juriſdiction, Eccleſiaſtical</hi> as well as Temporal, did originally belong to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Every <hi>Chronicle Writer</hi> can tell us when the power of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> prevailed, to lop off ſome of its Branches: And the <hi>Crown</hi> muſt needs have it before it could loſe it. But whether our modern conceptions of the <hi>Supremacy</hi> are adequate to that <hi>Ancient Legal Supremacy</hi> at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> of which we agree the reſtoring of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be but <hi>Declarative,</hi> is certainly worth <hi>their</hi> Enquiry, who pretending
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55049:7"/>that <hi>All</hi> Laws concerning it are but <hi>declarative,</hi> muſt either juſtifie that Poſition and other modern Aſcriptions from Antiquity, or confeſs the vanity of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ancient Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy</hi> of the Kings of this Realm, was no <hi>perſonal Prerogative:</hi> But our Kings were <hi>Head of the Church</hi> as they were <hi>Head of the State,</hi> governing both by Laws made by the ſame Authority (if deſigned to be binding to all) and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in the ſame Courts, till <hi>King</hi> William <hi>the Conqueror's</hi> Reign, and from that time downwards, in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> Courts apart.</p>
            <p>All Matters whatſoever concerning <hi>Religion, Diſcipline, Ceremonies,</hi> with all <hi>Laws, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever relating thereunto, by which the <hi>Laity</hi> were to be bound, were anciently Enacted by the ſame Authority that made our Temporal Laws: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Authority are not binding to the <hi>Laity</hi> to this day, nor ever were.</p>
            <p>Nor has the King any power by the Law to impoſe any <hi>New Article, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Practice, Rule,</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, upon the <hi>Clergy</hi> or any of them under any ſort of Penalty, without an Act of <hi>Convocation</hi> at leaſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Many Inſtances of this kind might have been added, as particularly that of the Council at <hi>Hatfield, An.</hi> 680. wherein the <hi>Canons</hi> of five <hi>General Councils</hi> were received; which was a <hi>Witena Gemote,</hi> a <hi>Conventus Sapientum:</hi> But I ſpare time, &amp; am endeavouring only to open a Door.</p>
            <p>By theſe Inſtances it is apparent, that the ſame Body of Men that enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Temporal Laws</hi> of the Kingdom, did in the very ſame <hi>Councils</hi> make Laws
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55049:13"/>for the Government of the Church. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the whole Fabrick of the <hi>Engliſh Saxon Church</hi> was built upon Acts of Parliament; nothing, in which the whole Community was concerned, was enacted, decreed or eſtabliſhed, but by that Authority. For whoſe reads impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially the Hiſtories of thoſe times, and compares them with one another, will find, that as moſt of thoſe Antient <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> commonly ſo called, were no other than (to ſpeak in our Modern Language) <hi>Parliaments;</hi> ſo not any thing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in <hi>Religion,</hi> obligatory to the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> whether in matters of <hi>Faith, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Ceremonies,</hi> or any <hi>Religious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances,</hi> was impoſed, but in ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies as no Man can deny to have been Parliaments of thoſe Times, that has not a Fore-head of Braſs. For the Preſence not of the <hi>King</hi>'s only, but of the <hi>Duces, Principes, Satrapae, Populus terrae,</hi> &amp;c. ſhews ſufficiently, that neither the <hi>Kings,</hi> nor the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Clergy,</hi> without the concurrent Authority of the ſame Perſons, that enacted <hi>Temporal Laws,</hi> could preſcribe <hi>General Laws</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion.</hi> I do not diſpute what Orders of Men among the <hi>Saxons</hi> were deſcribed by <hi>Duces, Principes,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55049:13"/>but ſure I am, that they were <hi>Lay-men;</hi> and as ſure, that they <hi>aſſented</hi> to and <hi>confirmed</hi> thoſe Laws, without whoſe <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> they had been no Laws: So that the <hi>Kings</hi> of thoſe Times had no greater <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> than in <hi>Temporal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tearing the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Power</hi> from the <hi>Temporal,</hi> was the curſed Root of the Kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> It was that that mounted the <hi>Papacy.</hi> Thoſe Powers never were diſtinct in <hi>England,</hi> nor moſt other Nations, till that <hi>See</hi> got the aſcendant. And it is a ſtrange incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency to argue one while, that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Pope</hi> de facto, <hi>formerly did by the Canon Law, that of right belongs to our Kings;</hi> and another while, that the ſeveral Acts that reſtore the <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juriſdiction to the Crown,</hi> are but <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative.</hi> It ſhews how little the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> is underſtood by Modern Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters of it, and how little they are acquainted with the antient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third <hi>Period of Time</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, ſhall be from the uniting of the ſeveral Kingdoms of the <hi>Saxons</hi> under one Monarchy, to the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>

            <p>The fourth Period of Time ſhall be from the <hi>Norman</hi> Entrance, down to the Reign of King <hi>John:</hi> In this time it was, that the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> ſuffered a Rape, and that four very conſiderable Branches were cut off.

            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's Reign, there was another Schiſm in the Popedom between <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> and <hi>Victor,</hi> upon which a <hi>great Council</hi> of <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> out of the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> met to determine, whether of the two ſhould
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55049:20"/>be acknowledged <hi>Pope</hi> within thoſe Realms. The matter was debated in <hi>Conſpectu Regum &amp; Praeſulum, coram u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſâ, quae convenerat, multitudine Cleri &amp; Populi.</hi> And <hi>Alexander</hi> was received for <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Schiſmaticks <hi>Excommunicated.</hi> The Hiſtory is in <hi>Nubrig.

            <p>Purſuant to which Preſident, when there hapned in King <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's time to be another Schiſm in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and <hi>Act. of Parliament</hi> was made, to declare who ſhould be received <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and a Law made for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the <hi>Clergy</hi> that ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the other <hi>Pope.

            <p>What thing can be more purely <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical,</hi> than the determining who it lawfully choſen to be the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop?</hi> And yet neither the <hi>King,</hi> nor <hi>the King and the Clergy</hi> would ſettle the point without the <hi>Laity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what has been ſaid it appears, That the <hi>Ancient Supremacy,</hi> of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Matters,</hi> was a very different thing, not ſo much from what it is now by <hi>Law,</hi> as from what it is apprehended to be by many amongſt us. The Error is fundamental, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55049:20"/>conſiſts in aſcribing Things, Acts, Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the King in perſon, which belonged to, were done and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by him no otherwiſe, than in <hi>his Courts.

               <note place="margin">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55049:21"/>faciant quaerere per conſuetudinem terrae, illos qui à Regno receſſerunt, &amp; niſi redire voluerint infra terminum nominatum, &amp; ſtare Juri in Curiâ Domini Regis, utla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentur,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Gervaſ. Dorobern.</hi> (who well underſtood it) tells us, was but renewing the <hi>Aſſize</hi> of <hi>Clarendon: Rex Angliae</hi> Henricus, <hi>convocatis Regni Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moribus apud</hi> Northamptoniam, <hi>reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vavit Aſſizam de</hi> Clarendon. Here we ſee, that ſuch as were aggrieved by a Sentence given by the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> were, purſuant to the Statutes of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> not to appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> but to the <hi>King:</hi> Which the Statute of <hi>Northampton,</hi> made but twelve years after, explains to be to the <hi>Curia Regis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this, and by what has been ſaid before upon this Subject, it appears, that the ultimate <hi>Appeal</hi> in Cauſes <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi> as well as <hi>Temporal,</hi> was to the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> or <hi>Parliament;</hi> and that, as the ſame Aſſemblies made Laws both for the Government of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> ſo the <hi>Supreme</hi> Judicature <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> was one and the ſame.</p>
            <p>After that time <hi>Appeals</hi> were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proſecuted in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Statute and the Aſſize of <hi>Clarendon</hi> notwithſtanding; but this was only by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55049:21"/>connivance. At laſt, when the Pope got the better of King <hi>John,</hi> who lay under great Diſadvantages, as all our Hiſtorians tell us; and that in his <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta</hi> theſe words were inſerted:
<note place="margin">V. <hi>Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> Pag. 258.</note> 
               <hi>Liceat unicuique de caetero exire de Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no noſtro, &amp; redire ſalvò &amp; ſecurè per terram &amp; aquam, ſalvâ fide noſtra,</hi> &amp;c. Then <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> multiplyed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very little Cauſe, and the Maſter-piece of Papal Encroachments was wrought effectually.</p>
            <p>But it cannot be too often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, that the Laws of <hi>Clarendon</hi> which gave the ultimate <hi>Appeal</hi> to the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> as aforeſaid, are ſo often ſtiled the <hi>Avitae Conſuetudines Regni:</hi> Which ſhews ſufficiently where the <hi>Supreme Judicature</hi> reſided, according to our old Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It appears by what has been ſaid, that King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror was acknowledged to be <hi>God's Vicar,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to govern his <hi>Church;</hi> and yet, that neither He nor his Succeſſors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make any <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Laws</hi> to bind the whole Kingdom, but in a <hi>General Council</hi> of the Kingdom: That the King's <hi>Supremacy</hi> was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Perſonal,</hi> that an Archbiſhop did as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55049:22"/>it were, <hi>appeal</hi> from himſelf in <hi>Perſon</hi> to himſelf in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that the <hi>King</hi> ſubmitted and owned the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That the ſame Archbiſhop under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Law to be, that the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the <hi>Laity</hi> was neceſſary to the making of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Laws,</hi> by which they were to be bound: That the <hi>King</hi> could not of his own Authority, permit a <hi>Legate</hi> to exerciſe his Office within the Realm: That leave to exerciſe his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice could not be given him but in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:</hi> That the <hi>King</hi> could not part with <hi>Inveſtitures</hi> if he would, without the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the <hi>People:</hi> That <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> determined, who ought to be received as <hi>Pope</hi> within the Realm: That <hi>Appeals</hi> were to the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> by the <hi>Avitae Conſuetudines Regni:</hi> And that <hi>Biſhops</hi> were elected in <hi>Parliament.</hi> Whence I conclude, that a <hi>Perſonal Supremacy</hi> has no warrant from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The clearing the <hi>Antient Supremacy</hi> and ſtating the <hi>Matter</hi> aright, is of great uſe in this preſent Age; in which, as one ſort of Men over-ſtock us with <hi>Jure Divino</hi>'s, ſo the <hi>Lawyers</hi> accoſt us often with the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Perogative</hi> at <hi>Common Law;</hi> and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55049:22"/>that this and the other <hi>Act</hi> is but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative</hi> of the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and gives the King no <hi>new</hi> Power. And yet, as the <hi>Divines</hi> have little or no ground for their <hi>Jure Divine</hi>'s; no more have the <hi>Lawyers</hi> in theſe Matters of the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> any thing to warrant their late <hi>Hyperbole</hi>'s, but Shadows and Imaginations: They found a Power exerciſed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> which they had good reaſon to think injurious to the <hi>Crown;</hi> they had heard, that <hi>from the beginning it was not ſo:</hi> And thus far they were right. But how it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed before the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> invaded it, they had forgot; it having been uſurpt upon Four hundred years before they were born. For it is in vain to look for a true Scheme of the <hi>Antient Legal Supremacy</hi> at a nearer diſtance than from the Reigns of King <hi>John,</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and ſo backwards. And yet we find no Reſolutions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what the <hi>Supremacy</hi> at <hi>Common Law</hi> was, and wherein it conſiſted, grounded upon Authorities of thoſe Times, which only can afford a right <hi>Idea</hi> of it: Nor indeed can any thing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55049:23"/>be found in our Old Books of Law, as <hi>Bracton, Glanvil, Britton, Fleta,</hi> the <hi>Mirrour,</hi> nor in the <hi>Antient Hiſtories</hi> of thoſe Times, that warrants ſuch an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy</hi> in the Crown as we now a-days dream of; no <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Matters,</hi> other than in <hi>Temporal</hi> (which in a Nation of <hi>Saxon</hi> deſcent, could never exclude the <hi>Ordines Regni</hi>) having ever entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the thoughts of Man, as lodged in the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Perſon,</hi> or any <hi>Temporal</hi> Prince. The <hi>Pope</hi> pretended to it, (but our <hi>Kings</hi> never did:) Only where the Conſtitutions of <hi>Clarendon</hi> mention <hi>Appeals</hi> from the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> they take up with the Letter, and examine no farther: As ſome <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> have aſcribed <hi>Phaenomena in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which they could give no rational Account of, to occult Qualities; ſo the Lawyers reſolve puzling Queſtions, by telling us Magiſterially, that ſo and ſo it was at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> as occult in theſe Matters to many of them, as any Secret of Nature to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.</p>
            <p>That Branch of 1<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 
               <hi>Eliz.</hi> which unites <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> appears by the Journal of the

            <p>Thoſe particular Branches of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> concerning the making of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Appeals,</hi> &amp;c. with ſome <hi>Temporary Laws,</hi> now expired, as they were guided and limited by poſitive Laws made in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time, and King <hi>Edward</hi>'s, and revived in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s; ſo they are grounded upon thoſe Laws only, and have no other Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo far forth as they are <hi>Perſonal.</hi> For the <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Legal Supremacy</hi> having been ſo long overſhadowed, as to be almoſt forgot, they did not upon the Reſtitution of it, return all things to their former eſtate. They preſcribed another courſe for <hi>Appeals,</hi> than had ever been known in our <hi>Law</hi> before: They did not reſume the Elections of <hi>Biſhops</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> who had had them formerly, but leaving a ſhew of an <hi>Election</hi> in the <hi>Conſiſtory,</hi> they au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize the <hi>King</hi> to name the Man. The
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55049:24"/>power of making <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Eccleſiaſtical</hi> for the Government of the whole Kingdom, we find no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of, no declarative Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, other than in the Recital of 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. For that Point had never been gained from them.</p>
            <p>From the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second downward, to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, we find little or nothing of any <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Church,</hi> made with <hi>aſſent</hi> of the <hi>Laity:</hi> For the <hi>Clergy</hi> had now eſtabliſhed their <hi>Exemption,</hi> and had ſet up <hi>Imperium in Imperio:</hi> But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Acts we meet with, ſetting Bounds to their Encroachments, and limiting their Juriſdiction, and all made by the ſame Authority that enacted the <hi>Temporal Laws</hi> of the Kingdom: And therefore the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> ſo far forth as it remained in the <hi>Crown,</hi> was not <hi>Perſonal,</hi> but exerted it ſelf in the Legiſlative Body of the Kingdom. For the <hi>Parliaments,</hi> tho in a great meaſure <hi>Anti-Chriſt-ridden,</hi> did not even in theſe Times, ſo far forget the old Conſtitution, as to let the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> run adriſt for all them, and be wholly managed either by

            <p>The Writs of <hi>Summons</hi> to <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> both antient and modern, have this ſpecial Clauſe in them: <hi>Pro quibuſdam arduis &amp; urgentibus nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis, nos, Statum &amp; defenſionem Regni Angliae &amp; Eccleſiae Anglicanae concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentibus, quoddam Parliamentum,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>By this <hi>Act</hi> it appears that in the Judgment of that <hi>Parliament</hi> a Patent to exerciſe the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Sheriff</hi> longer than a Year with a <hi>Non Obſtante</hi> of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of</hi> 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. was a Patent void <hi>in Law:</hi> For they recite the <hi>Act,</hi> not only as an <hi>Act in force,</hi> but that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular clauſe in it, whereby <hi>Non Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante's</hi> to it are declared to be <hi>void,</hi> as a reaſon why the Under-Sheriffs of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol</hi> could not be ſafe in acting contrary thereunto; without <hi>Aſſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which was therefore had for their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55049:35"/>Security, and would have been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, if a <hi>Patent</hi> with a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> had then been accounted legal.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> might be thought ſufficient to invalidate the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that <hi>Judgment,</hi> if any ſuch had been given; but the truth of it is, there never was any ſuch <hi>Judgment</hi> given, as that the <hi>King</hi> might by his <hi>Perogative</hi> diſpenſe with the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. by which it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly enacted, That no <hi>Non Obſtantes</hi> in ſuch caſe ſhall be available.

But they did not ground their Judgment upon the <hi>Non-Obſtante</hi> therein; for there is not a word ſpoken of the <hi>Non-Obſtante,</hi> but by <hi>Rocliffe</hi> (who was then ſecond Baron of the Exchequer,) after the Court had agreed the Patent to be good, By reaſon of a <hi>Proviſo</hi> in an Act of <hi>Reſumption.</hi> But I ſhall forbear meddling any more with that Caſe, for that a very good Account of it will be ſhortly given by another Hand; as

Other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Adjournments <hi>ad proximum Parliamentum,</hi> may be ſeen in <hi>Cotton</hi>'s <hi>Abridgment of the Records in the Tower.</hi> But that which ſurprizeth us is, That all our <hi>Judges</hi> ſince the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> ſhould have attained to ſuch an omniſcience in the Law, that I think I may confidently affirm, there has not been an Adjournment, <hi>ad proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Parliamentum propter difficultatem,</hi> theſe Hundred and fifty Years laſt paſt. Sure I am, that no Preſident
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55049:41"/>of any ſuch thing appears in our <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> Books of <hi>Law.</hi> And yet Caſes of as great moment, concern and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Government and the whole Nation, have come in queſtion within that ſpace of time, as ever did or could in former Ages.</p>
            <p>But there is a Notion broached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have greater <hi>Power</hi> and larger <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Matters, than in <hi>Temporal,</hi> and that by vertue of their <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy</hi> they may <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe</hi> with ſuch <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> as concern <hi>Religion.</hi> But they that ſay ſo, do not conſider, that before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had much leſs power in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> than in <hi>Temporal,</hi> and therefore they cannot have greater <hi>now,</hi> unleſs ſome <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> give it them. And therefore this power of <hi>diſpenſing</hi> with <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> muſt be given by ſome <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> ſince the <hi>Reformation;</hi> or elſe the King has it not.</p>
            <p>And admit for the preſent their <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> who would inveſt the <hi>King</hi> with whatever power the Pope <hi>de facto</hi> exerciſed here: Yet that will not ſerve
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55049:42"/>the turn, for as much as the <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whatever power he might claim, and attempt to exerciſe, yet was never allowed a power to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> concerning <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Matters,</hi> even when it was full Sea with him here in <hi>England.</hi> Take one remarkable Preſident out of <hi>Matt. Paris, p.</hi> 699. that in the Year of our Lord 1245. The King, the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and Great Men of the Realm (then Aſſembled in a moſt general Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>) drew up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Articles of Grievances againſt the Popes Exorbitances and Illegal Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one of which was conceived in theſe words; <hi>viz. Item, Gravatur Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> Angliae <hi>ex adjectione multiplici, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius infamis nuncii,</hi> Non Obſtante, <hi>per quem juramenti Religio, conſuetudines antiquae, Scripturarum vigor, conceſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num authoritas,</hi> Statuta <hi>Jura &amp; Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legia debilitantur &amp; evaneſcunt.</hi> And it cannot but ſeem ſtrange, that after ſuch publick Complaints (for many others of the like nature might be cited) of the whole Kingdom againſt <hi>Non Obſtante's,</hi> as intolerable Grievances they ſhould be afterwards countenanced, and ſcrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to ſuch a tranſcendent Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55049:42"/>as to fruſtrate <hi>Laws, Statutes,</hi> and <hi>Acts of Parliament;</hi> and that by vertue of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy</hi> by which the King is pretended to have whatever power the <hi>Pope</hi> had, when the <hi>Pope himſelf</hi> was never allowed <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe Preſidents and Authorities of former times, it may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to add what happened in the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>James the Firſt,</hi> and the beginning of King <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> upon occaſion of the <hi>Spaniſh Match,</hi> with relation to the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Roman Catholicks:</hi> The whole Negotiation of that Affair may be read at large in <hi>Ruſhworth's firſt Volume of Hiſtorical Collections,</hi> and in <hi>Prynne</hi>'s <hi>Introduction to the Archbiſhop of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury<hi>'s Tryal.</hi> I will only point at two or three paſſages that are moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to the preſent purpoſe. 1. King <hi>James</hi> in a Letter written with his own hand to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> has theſe words; <hi>viz. Leges noſtrates, quae mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam Catholicis, non mortem irrogant, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boleri aut reſcindi à</hi> nobis Seorſim <hi>non poſſe, leniri it a poſſe, cùm erit uſus, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploratum habeat Serenitas veſtra, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ut dictorum Catholicorum Romano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum animis manſuetudine ac lenitate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrâ
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55049:43"/>conciliatis, &amp;c.</hi> he had promiſed that no <hi>Romiſh Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Catholick</hi> ſhould be proceeded againſt for any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Crime; but for the other Laws, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet afterwards, when King <hi>James</hi> was made to believe that the Match was juſt upon the point of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, a <hi>Proclamation</hi> was prepared for <hi>granting a toleration to Papiſts,</hi> tho' it never came out. But <hi>Archbiſhop Abbot</hi> wrote a Letter in the nature of a Remonſtrance to King <hi>James,</hi> in which beſides other Conſiderations of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> theſe words follow, <hi>Prynne</hi>'s <hi>Introduct. p.</hi> 40. <hi>Beſides, this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration which you endeavour to ſet by your Proclamation, cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Parliament, unleſs your Majeſty will let your Subjects ſee, that you will take unto your ſelf a Liberty to throw down the Laws of the Land at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Second Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, the King commanded his <hi>Attorney General</hi> to charge the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> at the Bar of the Houſe of <hi>Lords</hi> with <hi>High Treaſon</hi> and other <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences</hi> and <hi>Miſdemeanours,</hi> that they might proceed in a legal Courſe againſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55049:43"/>him, according to the Juſtice and uſual Proceedings of <hi>Parliaments;</hi> the <hi>fifth</hi> of which <hi>Articles</hi> is in theſe words, <q rend="margSglQuotes">That from the beginning of his Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and throughout the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging thereof by the ſaid <hi>Earl of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> and during his ſaid Ambaſſage, he the ſaid <hi>Earl,</hi> contrary to his Faith and Duty to <hi>God,</hi> the true <hi>Religion</hi> profeſſed by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the Peace of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> did intend and reſolve, that if the ſaid Marriage ſo treated of as aforeſaid, ſhould by his Miniſtry be effected, that thereby the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> and the Profeſſors thereof, ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced within this <hi>Realm,</hi> and other his Majeſties Realms and Dominions, and the <hi>true Religion</hi> and the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors thereof diſcouraged and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced. And to that end and purpoſe the ſaid <hi>Earl,</hi> during the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, by Letters unto his late Majeſty, and otherwiſe often counſelled and perſuaded his ſaid late Majeſty to ſet at Liberty the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> which according to the good, Religious and Publick <hi>Laws</hi> of this Kingdom, were impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or reſtrained; and <hi>to grant and to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55049:44"/>allow unto the Papiſts and Profeſſors of the Romiſh Religion, free Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſilencing of all Laws made and ſtanding in force againſt them. Vide</hi> Ruſhworth, <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 251. <hi>and</hi> Prinne<hi>'s Introduct. p.</hi> 32.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that King <hi>James</hi> thought himſelf had no power to <hi>reſcind or repeal the Laws Seorſim,</hi> tho' he could ſo mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the execution of them, as to make his <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Subjects be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to him. Yet when afterwards, in hopes of obtaining the <hi>Infanta</hi> for his Son, he had agreed to iſſue a <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for Indulgence to <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and a <hi>Proclamation</hi> was drawn accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, but never publiſhed; we may read the Senſe of the <hi>Church of England</hi> upon it in <hi>Archbiſhop Abbot</hi>'s Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance. The Reaſon why the <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> was not publiſhed, was becauſe the putting of it in practice or not, was to depend upon the ſucceſs of the <hi>Match,</hi> which miſcarrying, the Proclamation was ſtifled. And that may be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the <hi>Parliament</hi> in 21 <hi>Jacobi</hi> take no notice of it. But in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 2 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. The Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was charged by the <hi>King's</hi> own Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for having perſuaded the <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55049:44"/>to it, as having committed a very high Crime in ſo doing. Whereas if the <hi>King</hi> had a power by Law to do it, it could not well be a Crime in him, to perſuade him to make uſe of his Power, when the Circumſtances of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs required it.</p>
            <p>And as it was then conceived a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour to Adviſe the <hi>King</hi> to it, ſo who knows how far future <hi>Parliaments</hi> may account it a Miſdemeanour to have been in any wiſe inſtrumental towards the carrying on of a deſign, which ſome will not ſtick to ſay now, as the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> did then, is to give the <hi>King</hi> a Power of throwing down all the Laws of the Land at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to give ſome ſmall account of the riſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> with <hi>Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi> by which it does appear, that as the clauſe of <hi>Non Obſtante</hi> was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced <hi>by Popes,</hi> and firſt applied by the inſtigation of the <hi>Popiſh Clergy,</hi> to break through <hi>Acts of Parliaments,</hi> (tho' our <hi>Parliaments</hi> never Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced them, and our <hi>Courts of Juſtice</hi> never extended <hi>the diſpenſing power</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to particular perſons, or at
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55049:45"/>moſt to <hi>Corporations</hi>) ſo <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> ſuſpending at one blow the whole effect of <hi>Laws,</hi> were invented at <hi>Rome</hi> too, in favour of <hi>Engliſh Papiſts,</hi> upon the Treaty of the <hi>Spaniſh Match</hi> in King <hi>James</hi>'s time: But they never appeared bare-faced in view till King <hi>Charles the Second's</hi> time; in whoſe Reign they were twice damned in Parliament. The third effort has been made of late, ſince which no <hi>Parliament</hi> has yet ſat down.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, conſidering the great Solemnity and Caution that is uſed in paſſing <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> that ſo <hi>impudent</hi> a conceit, as that of the <hi>Legality</hi> of a <hi>diſpenſing Power,</hi> ſhould ever enter into the thoughts of Men.</p>
            <p>For if a Bill be firſt brought into the Houſe of <hi>Lords,</hi> after it is read, it is committed to a Committee of <hi>Lords,</hi> and certain <hi>Judges</hi> are appointed to attend them, that nothing may be put into the <hi>Act,</hi> which may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, when it comes to be read in the Houſe again, the <hi>Judges</hi> ſit as At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants upon the Houſe, and hear all the Debates of the <hi>Lords</hi> upon it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have no Voice in the Houſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55049:45"/>of <hi>Lords,</hi> but if any <hi>Bill</hi> that is paſſing ſhould in their Judgments have any ill Conſequences to the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> they might either have offered their Reaſons at the <hi>Committee,</hi> or ſuggeſted what their thoughts were to ſome of the <hi>Lords</hi> in the Houſe, who would have acquainted the Houſe with it. A <hi>Bill</hi> having paſſed the Houſe of <hi>Lords</hi> with all this Caution, is afterwards ſent down to the <hi>Commons</hi> by ſome of the <hi>Judges</hi> themſelves, and ſometimes by the <hi>Chief Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Chief Baron,</hi> who coming into the Houſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> with Reverence, and the reſpect of three Bows, deliver the <hi>Bill</hi> to the <hi>Speaker.</hi> And the method is the ſame in caſe of a <hi>Bill</hi> coming from the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> and committed by the <hi>Lords,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Judges</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appointed to attend and wait upon the <hi>Committee</hi> of the <hi>Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all this Solemnity, the Bill yet ſignifies nothing, without the <hi>Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to which, before the <hi>King</hi> is to give it, the Clerks of the Houſe of <hi>Lords</hi> are to bring the <hi>Bills</hi> before the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> before whom they are read, and not only the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55049:46"/>
               <hi>King's Council</hi> are ordered to attend, and be preſent, but likewiſe all the <hi>Judges</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall:</hi> And if any <hi>Bills</hi> ſhould be thought of miſchievous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, they, as being the <hi>King's Council</hi> in Matters of <hi>Law,</hi> are bound by the expreſs tenour of their <hi>Oath,</hi> to ſhew and diſcloſe it to the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if no ſuch thing be done, then the <hi>King</hi> in full <hi>Parliament</hi> gives his <hi>Le Roy le Voet,</hi> and ſo it becomes a general Law, to bind the <hi>whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>

            <p>Now after a <hi>Law</hi> made with ſuch caution and ſolemnity is entred upon <hi>Record,</hi> as a <hi>Statute</hi> binding to the <hi>whole Kingdom;</hi> it muſt needs ſeem ſtrange, that the <hi>Judges</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> ſhould dare to allow of <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> with ſuch a <hi>Law,</hi> grounded upon the <hi>ſole Act of the Prince:</hi> and much more, that they ſhould, as a late <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Author</hi> tells us they have done, declare Acts of Parliament to be <hi>void,</hi>

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:55049:46"/>nay and themſelves too, or at leaſt their Predeceſſors, for want of Knowledge, Prudence or Foreſight, as not being capable to judge of common Senſe, or not fore-ſeeing Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which either themſelves now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or would perſuade us the <hi>King</hi> by ſome new illumination has diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: <hi>eſpecially</hi> when theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, if real, may eaſily be redreſſed In <hi>Parliament,</hi> without having recourſe to a <hi>Weſtminſter Hall Prerogative,</hi> or Dreams of <hi>Imperial Power</hi> vampt up with Ignorance, a good Fancy, and a tollerable Pen, by ſome ſcurrilous Authors, whoſe names I cannot prevail upon my ſelf to defile paper with.</p>
            <p>I cannot leave this period of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt King <hi>John</hi> and King <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> without a remark upon an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> made in the Second Year of King <hi>Henry the Fifth,</hi> cap. 1. That <hi>Act recites that many Hoſpitals have been founded by the Kings of this Realm and divers other Eſtates of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to which Hoſpitals the Founders have given part of their moveable Goods and of their Lands, therewith to ſuſtain impotent Men and Women,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that the ſame Hoſpitals be now for the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55049:47"/>moſt part decayed, and the Goods and Profits of the ſame withdrawn and ſpent in other uſes: And therefore Enacts, That as to the Hoſpitals which be of the</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage and Foundation of the King, the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> by vertue of the King's Commiſſions to them directed, <hi>ſhall enquire of the manner and foundation of the ſaid Hoſpitals, and of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Eſtate of the ſame, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters requiſite and neceſſary in that behalf, and the Inquiſitions thereof ſhall certifie into the King's Chancery; And as to other Hoſpitals,</hi> which be of another Foundation and Patronage <hi>than of the King, the Ordinaries ſhall enquire of the manner of the Foundation, Eſtate and Governance of the ſame, and of all other Matters and Things neceſſary in this behalf, and upon that make due cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and reformation, according to the Laws of Holy Church, as to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Act apparently makes a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> that are, and that are not <hi>of the King's Foundation and Patronage,</hi> with reſpect to the Right of <hi>Viſitation.</hi> Thoſe of the <hi>King's Foundation</hi> the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> were to <hi>viſit</hi> by the <hi>King's Commiſſion.</hi> But
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55049:47"/>thoſe that were not of the <hi>King's Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> were to <hi>viſit</hi> too, but how? <hi>Not by any Commiſſion from the King, but as ſpecial Commiſſioners, ſpecial Viſitors, appointed by that Act.</hi> The King did not pretend to iſſue a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to <hi>Viſit</hi> an Hoſpital of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject's <hi>Foundation.</hi> The Parliament were ſtrangers to ſuch a conceit. The right of Viſiting, <hi>de communi Jure</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>Founder;</hi> he that gave the <hi>Laws,</hi> ought to ſee them executed. If the <hi>Parliament</hi> had appointed that Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals of the <hi>Foundation</hi> of Subjects, ſhould be <hi>Viſited</hi> by the Ordinaries <hi>by Commiſſion from the King;</hi> they had in effect tranſlated the Rights of all <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> that were Subjects to the King, which they never intended.</p>
            <p>For the Legal Notion of <hi>Viſitation</hi> in ſuch Caſes, is no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> A Man <hi>Founds</hi> and <hi>Endows a College.</hi> The Rule of <hi>Law</hi> and of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teaches, <hi>cujus eſt dare, ejus eſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere.</hi> As a Man may give Lands to a private perſon upon what condition the Donor pleaſes, provided it be not againſt <hi>Law:</hi> ſo a Man may give Lands to a Society of Men upon what terms he pleaſes. The terms expreſt in the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:55049:48"/>are called the private <hi>Laws,</hi> by which the Society is to be ordered and governed. And juſt as when a Man makes a Leaſe for Life or Years, the Leſſor may enter of right to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waſte be done or no, ſo a <hi>Founder</hi> may come and enquire whether thoſe of his <hi>Foundation</hi> obſerve the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> preſcribed by him or his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; and proceed according to the <hi>Statutes</hi> and the Powers thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in caſe he find any neglect or miſdemeanour. What right the <hi>King</hi> has to interpoſe his Authority in ſuch caſe, any more than in the Government of a private Family, I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Colleges in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be viſitable by the <hi>King's Commiſſion,</hi> by vertue of his <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority:</hi> Here we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. A College of Divines, for <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, founded</hi> by a Subject and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, and receiving <hi>Laws</hi> for their Governance from their <hi>Founder,</hi> are viſitable by their <hi>Founder</hi> and his Heirs or Succeſſors. They may be alſo (for any thing here alledged to the contrary) <hi>viſitable</hi> by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> or (if exempt from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55049:48"/>Juriſdiction</hi>) by the <hi>King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> But what Power have theſe <hi>Viſitors?</hi> The <hi>Founder</hi> enquires, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Statutes of the <hi>Foundation</hi> are obſerved, and puniſhes according to the <hi>Statutes,</hi> but goes no farther. The <hi>Ordinary,</hi> or <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> or (if the place be exempt) the <hi>King's Viſitors</hi> enquire, Whether they profeſs the Doctrin, and obſerve the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the King had any thing to do to intermeddle with the Statutes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſuch a College in the <hi>firſt Inſtance,</hi> by virtue of his <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Supremacy,</hi> it ſeems very ſtrange that in the third and fourth Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, when the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Founder of <hi>Maud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn College</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> had at a <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> deprived the <hi>Preſident,</hi> and he appealed to the Queen in <hi>Chancery;</hi> the <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Civilians</hi> having had a Conference upon the Buſineſs, agreed, that the Appeal lay not as the Law then ſtood; for that this Caſe was out of the Statutes of 24 and 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. (which direct <hi>Appeals</hi> to the King in <hi>Chancery</hi>) and this Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55049:49"/>was a meer <hi>Temporal Thing,</hi> and inflicted as by a <hi>Lay Patron:</hi> And that, if he were wrongfully expelled, he might have an <hi>Aſſize,</hi> or other Suit at <hi>Common Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>King's</hi> Power with reſpect to the private Statutes of a <hi>College</hi> of a Subjects <hi>Foundation,</hi> I will acquaint the Reader with one <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> made 1 <hi>Mariae,</hi> which will yield ſome very uſeful Inferences. The Act recites,</p>
            <q rend="margSglQuotes">
               <p>Whereas the late Noble Prince of Famous Memory, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, Father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our moſt Gracious Sovereign La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the <hi>Queen,</hi> amongſt other his godly Acts and Doings, did erect, make and eſtabliſh divers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry <hi>Churches,</hi> as well <hi>Cathedral</hi> as <hi>Collegiat,</hi> and endowed every of the ſame with divers Mannors, Lands, Tenements and Poſſeſſions, for the maintenance of the Deans, Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries and Miniſters within the ſame, and for other charitable Acts to be done and executed by the ſame Deans, Prebendaries and Miniſters, and alſo did incorporate the ſame Deans, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries and Miniſters, and made them Bodies politick in perpetual Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55049:49"/>according to the Laws of this Realm of <hi>England:</hi> And where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as the ſaid late <hi>King,</hi> for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maintenance and preſervation of the ſaid Churches, in a godly Unity, and good Order and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, granted unto the ſeveral Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations and Bodies Corporate of every of the ſaid Churches, that they ſhould be ruled and governed for ever, <hi>according unto certain Ordinances, Rules and Statutes, to be ſpecified in certain Indentures, then after to be made by his Highneſs,</hi> and to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and declared to every of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Corporate of the ſaid ſeveral Churches, as by the ſaid ſeveral E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and Foundations of the ſaid Churches, more plainly it doth and may appear: Since which ſaid Erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Foundations, the ſaid late <hi>King</hi> did cauſe to be delivered to every of the ſaid Churches, ſo as is aforeſaid erected and incorporated, by certain Commiſſioners by his Highneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, divers and ſundry <hi>Statutes and Ordinances,</hi> made and decreed by the ſame Commiſſioners, for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Rule and Governances of the ſaid ſeveral Churches, and of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55049:50"/>Deans, Prebendaries, and Miniſters of the ſame; which ſaid <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> were made by the ſaid Commiſſioners, and delivered unto every of the Corporations of the ſaid ſeveral Churches in writing, <hi>but not indented,</hi> according to the Form of the ſaid <hi>Foundations</hi> and <hi>Erections;</hi> by reaſon whereof the ſaid Churches, and the ſeveral Deans, Prebendaries, and Miniſters of the ſame, have no <hi>Statutes</hi> or <hi>Ordinances</hi> of any Force or Authority, whereby they ſhould be ruled and governed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remain as yet not fully eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in ſuch ſort, as the godly intent of the ſaid late King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was, to the great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>Churches,</hi> and the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of God's Service, and good Order and Regiment to be had and continued amongſt the Miniſters of the ſame.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch <hi>as the Authority of the making of the ſaid Statutes, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Orders, was reſerved only unto the ſaid King, and no mention made of any like Authority to be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto his Heirs and Succeſſors, the ſame Orders, and Statutes, cannot now
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55049:50"/>be made and provided without Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>And then the Act proceeds to empower that Queen <hi>during her Life,</hi> to preſcribe ſuch <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Statutes;</hi> and to <hi>alter, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, change, augment or diminiſh the ſaid Orders, Statutes,</hi> &amp;c. And gives her likewiſe Authority to <hi>make, ordain, and eſtabliſh Statutes, Ordinances and Foundations for the good Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Grammar Schools erected by King</hi> Hen. 8. <hi>or King Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>and to alter Statutes already made.</hi> V. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall's Statutes, 1 Mar. Par. 2. Act 9.</p>
            <p>And ſhe dying before the work was finiſhed, there was another Act in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time impowering her to do the like, and to alter the Statutes in being.</p>
            <p>Hence I infer, firſt, if King <hi>Henry the Eighth</hi> having reſerved a Power to himſelf of appointing private <hi>Laws, &amp;c.</hi> as aforeſaid, and coming to die without executing that Power, his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor could not make ſuch <hi>Laws,</hi> though for the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Colleges,</hi> &amp;c. of which the <hi>King himſelf</hi> was <hi>Founder</hi> (as moſt evidently, according to the Opinion of thoſe two <hi>Queens</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:55049:51"/>and their <hi>Parliaments,</hi> ſhe could not) and for the Government of <hi>Colleges,</hi> &amp;c. that had no private <hi>Laws</hi> at all for their good Order and Government, then a power given by <hi>Commiſſion to Survey, Alter, Reform, Amend,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Statutes of the Foundation of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, Halls,</hi> &amp;c. was not in thoſe days look'd upon as Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the <hi>King</hi> could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>New Laws for</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Colleges,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>his own Foundation,</hi> then he could not alter the Statutes of <hi>Colleges</hi> founded by <hi>Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I infer from hence in the third place, that ſome Commiſſion grounded upon theſe Statutes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which were Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and gave thoſe <hi>Queens</hi> Power but for Life; has been the pattern for that Clauſe in a late <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> which relates to the <hi>Colleges</hi> in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> &amp;c. And that the Gentleman who drew the late Commiſſion, had forgot thoſe two Acts of <hi>Queen Mary</hi> and <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> becauſe the latter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was printed, and the former, being expired long before <hi>his</hi> Statute-Book was printed, is left out of it (but it is to be ſeen in <hi>Raſtall.</hi>)</p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:55049:51"/>
            <p>And finding ſuch a Commiſſion upon the <hi>Roll,</hi> he concluded the <hi>King</hi> had a Power by the <hi>Common Law</hi> to grant it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Archbiſhop Laud</hi> pretended to <hi>viſit</hi> both <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, Jure Metropolitico,</hi> and it was decreed at the Council Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he had right to <hi>viſit;</hi> but he claimed only a Right to <hi>viſit</hi> them, as to their <hi>Doctrin,</hi> and <hi>Church Diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> not to meddle with the private Statutes of their <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Which he diſclaimed any Right to enquire into. V. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I mention this only to ſhew how a <hi>College</hi> may be ſubject to a <hi>double Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation</hi> diverſo reſpectu.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion is not here concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>King's</hi> Authority to viſit the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> but what Authority he has to viſit a <hi>private College</hi> for their good Government, and to meddle with their <hi>Statues, himſelf not being the Founder,</hi> I cannot ſee as yet.</p>
            <p>HAVING given ſome Account of the Nature of the <hi>Antient Legal Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which in former Ages the <hi>Crown</hi> claim'd and exercis'd in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Matters;</hi> come we now to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign, in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55049:52"/>whoſe time all Foreign Power was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the <hi>Antient Supremacy</hi> reſtor'd, and <hi>New Powers</hi> given, ſome to that King <hi>perſonally,</hi> ſome to Him, his Heirs and Succeſſors. I ſhall run through the <hi>Acts,</hi> as they lye in order of Time.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Act</hi> that made an open Breach with <hi>Rome,</hi> was that of 24 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. That no <hi>Appeals ſhould be uſed, but within the Realm:</hi> The Preamble to that <hi>Act</hi> will afford us conſiderable Obſervations, and very pertinent to the chief Subject and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this preſent Diſcourſe. It runs thus: <hi>Where by divers, ſundry, old, authentick Hiſtories and Chronicles, it is manifeſtly declared and expreſſed, That this Realm of</hi> England <hi>is an Empire, and ſo hath been accepted in the World, governed by one</hi> Supreme Head <hi>and</hi> King, <hi>having the Dignity and Royal Eſtate of the Imperial Crown of the ſame: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom a Body Politick, compact of all ſorts and degrees of People, divided in Terms, and by Names of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualty and Temporalty, been bounden and own to bear, next to God, a natural and humble Obedience: He being alſo inſtitute and furniſhed, by the Goodneſs and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance of Almighty God, with plenary,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55049:52"/>whole and entire Power, Pre-eminence and Authority, Prerogative and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to render and yield Juſtice, and final determination to all manner of folk Reſiants, or Subjects within this his Realm, in all Cauſes, Matters, Debates and Contentions, happening to occur, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurge and begin within the Limits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, without reſtraint or provocation to any Foreign Princes and Potentates of the World; The Body Spiritual where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of having Power, when any cauſe of the Law divine cometh in queſtion, or of Spiritual Learning, that it was declared and ſhewed, by that part of the ſaid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick, called the Spiritualty, now being uſually called the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Church; which always hath been reputed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo found of that ſort, that both for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it hath been thought, and is ſufficient and meet of it ſelf, without the intermedling of any exterior Perſon or Perſons, to declare and determine all ſuch Doubts, and to adminiſter all ſuch Offices and Duties, as to their Rooms Spiritual doth appertain: And the Law Temporal, for tryal of Property of Lands and Goods, and for the conſervation of the People of this Realm in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Peace, without Rapine or Spoil, was and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55049:53"/>yet is adminiſtred, adjudged and executed by ſundry Judges and Miniſters of the other part of the ſaid Body Politick, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Temporalty; and both their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions and Authorities, do conjoin together in the due Adminiſtration of Juſtice, the one to help the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this part of the Preamble we may obſerve, Firſt, That for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi>'s being an <hi>Empire,</hi> conſiſting of two Eſtates of Men, and governed by <hi>One Supreme Head,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> appeal to <hi>old, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Chronicles;</hi> and conſequently, wherein the power of this <hi>One Supreme Head</hi> doth conſiſt, muſt be learnt from Antiquity. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly. That the Excluſion of <hi>Foreign Juriſdiction</hi> was the main thing in their Eye; <hi>without reſtraint or provocation to any Foreign Princes or Potentates of the World.</hi> Thirdly, That as this <hi>Supreme Head</hi> adminiſtred ordinary Juſtice to his Subjects in Matters <hi>Temporal,</hi> by proper <hi>Officers, ſundry Judges and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters;</hi> ſo in <hi>Cauſes of the Law Divine, or of Spiritual Learning, the ſame was to be declared, interpreted and ſhewn by the Spiritualty,</hi> (which is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>ordinary</hi> Proceedings.) And
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55049:53"/>conſequently, not by <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the <hi>Supreme Head:</hi> For he can appoint no <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Matters of civil Right, but where ſpecial <hi>Acts</hi> empower him, and no <hi>Act</hi> had yet impowered him to do ſo in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Matters;</hi> nor did his Predeceſſors or himſelf, practiſe it till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: For his <hi>divers, ſundry, old Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> afforded him no preſident of any ſuch thing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be either in the nature of the thing, or in the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Parliament,</hi> any eſſential part of his <hi>Legal Supreme Headſhip,</hi> to have a <hi>Perſonal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> either independant of the Eſtates of the Realm, or which might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred otherwiſe than in the Courſe ſetled by Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> by <hi>proper Officers,</hi> appointed thereunto either by expreſs <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> or the <hi>Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> or both.</p>
            <p>The Body of the <hi>Act</hi> prohibits <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and enacts, <hi>That in ſuch Caſes, where heretofore any of the King's Subjects and Reſiants have uſed to purſue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>any Appeal to the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>and in all other caſes of Appeals, in and for the Cauſes aforeſaid,

            <p>Hitherto no <hi>Appeal</hi> lay to the <hi>King in Perſon,</hi> or in <hi>Chancery:</hi> You have heard already, that originally the ultimate <hi>Appeal</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Temporal Matters,</hi> was to one and the ſame <hi>Tribunal.</hi> Afterwards the See of <hi>Rome</hi> gained <hi>Appeals</hi> by Uſurpation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance.

            <p>It looks like a blemiſh to the Notion of <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> in the <hi>modern</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the Word, to have the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Judgment in Cauſes <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> referr'd by the <hi>Parliament</hi> to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Archbiſhops,</hi> or to <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> appointed by vertue of an <hi>Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> &amp;c. and yet the <hi>Parliament</hi> in 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. takes Notice of, and allows the <hi>Clergy's Recognition,</hi> nor was it till many Years after, to wit, the 39 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> that the <hi>Lawyers</hi> found out a way to make theſe <hi>Acts</hi> conſiſtent with their imaginary <hi>perſonal</hi> Supreme Headſhip; and that was by introducing <hi>Commiſſions of Review.</hi> Which they tell us the <hi>King, after ſuch a definitive ſentence may grant, as Supreme Head,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55049:56"/>Ad revidendum,</hi> 4 <hi>Inſtit. p.</hi> 341. Where two reaſons are given for it, Firſt, <hi>For that it is not reſtrained by the Act,</hi> which ſeems to be a miſtake: For it is <hi>reſtrain'd</hi> by the <hi>Act,</hi> as much as it was capable of being <hi>reſtrain'd;</hi> and that by theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>ſuch Judgment and Sentence as the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſhall make and decree, in and upon ſuch Appeals, ſhall be good and effectual, and alſo definitive.</hi> How could <hi>Commiſſions of Review</hi> be <hi>reſtrain'd</hi> more expreſly, than by theſe words? They are not nam'd indeed, and good reaſon why, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe there never had been any ſuch things in our Law before. For he, that will apply to this Caſe that common Rule of <hi>Law, viz.</hi> that <hi>where the King is not named in a Statute, he is not intended to be bound by it;</hi> muſt prove that <hi>Appeals</hi> lay to the King in <hi>Perſon</hi> or in <hi>Chancery,</hi> before theſe <hi>Acts</hi> were made. And then perhaps I may yield, that ſuch <hi>Commiſſions of Review</hi> are not hereby reſtrained.</p>

               </note> that the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's</hi> Decree upon Complaint of a perſon aggrieved by a Decree of the <hi>Commiſſioners of Charitable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> is <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi> upon which no Bill of Review is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55049:56"/>to be allow'd? Why, becauſe the <hi>Statute of</hi> 43 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. gives an Appeal to him, and goes no higher. And ſince there were no ſuch <hi>Commiſſions</hi> of <hi>Charitable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> before that Statute, therefore the Statute, being <hi>introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of a new Law,</hi> muſt be purſued, and where the Statute does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Remedy there is none.

So far forth as they concern <hi>Appeals,</hi> are for the moſt part <hi>introductive</hi> of New Laws too. And the latter of them gives <hi>Appeals</hi> to the King in <hi>Chancery,</hi> which never lay before. And therefore, as. the <hi>Act</hi> gives them, he ought to take them, and no otherwiſe; for the Act is his title, and it has negative words.</p>
            <p>But the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Error in aſcribing that Power, Juriſdiction, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>perſon,</hi> which was <hi>ab origine</hi> in <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> runs through almoſt all that he has written upon that Subject. And our <hi>Lawyers</hi> (who look upon him as an Oracle, for his Learning and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Controverſial, profitable part of the Law, in which he was unqueſtionably a very great Man) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

            <p>The Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s ſecond Reaſon for a <hi>Commiſſion of Review,</hi> to examine a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive Sentence given by the <hi>Delegates,</hi> is, becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Supreme Head</hi> by the <hi>Canon Law</hi> us'd to grant a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <hi>ad revidendum,</hi> and ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as the <hi>Pope</hi> had, claiming as <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> doth of right belong to the Crown, and is annexed thereunto
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55049:57"/>by the Statutes of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. And ſo it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, ſays he, in the King's Bench, <hi>Trin.</hi> 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on't is; the King may do ſo, becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> did ſo; for the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Supreme Head</hi> then, or claimed to be ſo, and the King is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be ſo now.</p>
            <p>This pretended Tranſlation of the <hi>Pope's</hi> Power to the <hi>King,</hi> is another fiction, that has contributed exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to raiſe the <hi>Supremacy</hi> in ſome Mens Imaginations.</p>
            <p>But it will appear by running through the ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> made in King <hi>Henry the Eighth</hi>'s, King <hi>Edward the Sixth</hi>'s, and <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s Reigns, concerning Religion and Church Government, that no Power given to the <hi>King,</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be in him, has any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or relation whatſoever to the Pope's pretended Power, heretofore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed.

            <p>That ſuch Authority as the <hi>Pope</hi> had, does of right belong to the <hi>King,</hi> he would prove by the Statutes of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Elizabeth, cap.</hi> 1.

            <p>He gives us a <hi>Corollary, viz.</hi> that upon a <hi>Sentence given by the High Commiſſioners, a Commiſſion of Review may be granted,</hi> by vertue of an expreſs Clauſe in the Commiſſion; <hi>and if no ſuch Clauſe had been,</hi> ſays he, <hi>yet a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Review might have been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Quia ſicut fontes Communicant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas fluminibus cumulativè, non priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſic Rex ſubditis ſuis Juriſdictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem communicat in cauſis Eccleſiaſticis, vigore Statuti in ejuſmodi caſibus editi,

            <p>I would fain know, whether a Cauſe determined by Virtue of this <hi>Act</hi> in the <hi>

            <p>Do theſe Men really believe that the <hi>Judicial Authority</hi> of the Nation, is by the <hi>Law</hi> lodg'd in the <hi>King's Perſon?</hi> What means then the Act of 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>That neither his Majeſty nor his

            <p>I will dwell no longer upon theſe <hi>Acts</hi> concerning <hi>Appeals.</hi> It appears (I hope) already, that <hi>Appeals,</hi> which by the <hi>Antient Law</hi> of the Realm, were to the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> had been gain'd from it to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> That King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth cauſed ſuch Foreign <hi>Appeals</hi> to be reſtrain'd, and directed how they ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted within the Realm for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

            <p>This <hi>Act</hi> cannot be pretended to give the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> any new power: For it is penn'd in <hi>Negative Words.</hi> It is but <hi>declarative</hi> of what the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Law</hi> of the Kingdom was.

               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:55049:61"/>had got an Exemption from the <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Laws, and lookt upon themſelves as a diſtinct, ſeparate Body of Men from the reſt of the <hi>King</hi>'s Subjects, as having a dependance upon, and owing Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Obedience to a Foreign Head; then they proceeded to make <hi>Canons</hi> without conſent of the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty.</hi> But even in thoſe days when ever they entrench't upon the <hi>Common Law</hi> of the Realm, which was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Fence and Protection, the <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Courts</hi> gall'd them with <hi>Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> They had not in the times of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> a Power of binding the <hi>Laity,</hi> even in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> without their <hi>Aſſent.</hi> But themſelves they bound, and the inferior Clergy were all ſubjected to the Power of <hi>Provincial Synods,</hi> becauſe of their Oath of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Obedience:</hi> And theſe <hi>Canons</hi> by which they bound the whole Body of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> never had any <hi>Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> to them ſince King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s days. No <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Laws,</hi> other than what were enacted in <hi>Parliament,</hi> having ſince that <hi>King's</hi> Reign derived their Authority from the <hi>King.</hi> This Act there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ties up the <hi>Clergy</hi> from any power of making <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55049:61"/>the <hi>King.</hi> But ſince it gives them no manner of Power or Authority whatſoever, their Power (even the <hi>Royal Aſſent</hi> taken in) is no other ſince this Act, than it was before they had withdrawn themſelves from the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Laity:</hi> Which how far it extended has been ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd already.</p>
            <p>I will not go ſo far as ſome have done, to affirm,
<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edward Bagſhaw</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Canons.</note> that the <hi>King's Aſſent</hi> here ſpoken of, muſt be underſtood of his <hi>Aſſent</hi> in <hi>Parliament.</hi> But I think it is very obſervable, that the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> did by this <hi>Act</hi> appoint <hi>Sixteen</hi> of the <hi>Two</hi> and <hi>thirty</hi> Commiſſioners, (who were <hi>to view, ſearch and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Canons, Conſtitutions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances Provincial and Synodal hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made,</hi> in order to the keeping of ſome and rejecting others) to be of the <hi>

            <p>Nay, they ſeem, as it were, jealous leſt this <hi>Act,</hi> tho as cautiouſly penn'd as the Wit of Man could contrive it, ſhould be made uſe of to colour ſome unwarrantable Power of the <hi>Clergy</hi> in Convocation, having the <hi>Royal Aſſent</hi> to their <hi>Conſtitutions:</hi> And therefore they add a ſpecial <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that no <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Conſtitutions or Ordinances, ſhall be made or put in execution within this Realm, by the Authority of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Clergy, which ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariant or repugnant to the King's Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royal, or the Cuſtoms, Laws or Statutes of the Realm.</hi> Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was againſt the Laws of the Realm or not, in the Opinion of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> to top any <hi>Laws</hi> upon them without their <hi>conſent,</hi> will appear by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble of another <hi>Act</hi> of this very Seſſion of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and therefore I will paſs it by now.</p>
            <p>Nor was there any thing in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture practice of this <hi>King's</hi> Reign, which gave or aſſerted any Power to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Convocation,</hi> to bind or conclude the People without an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> concurring and enforcing the ſame.</p>

            <p>The next <hi>Act</hi> is the <hi>Twentieth Chap.</hi> of this ſame Seſſion of <hi>Parliament,</hi> concerning the <hi>Election and Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops.</hi> This Act does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the <hi>Election</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> from whom it had been gain'd, but leaving a ſhadow of <hi>Election</hi> in the <hi>Conſiſtory,</hi> impowers the <hi>King</hi> to name the Perſon, commands the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> under the Penalty of a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> to chooſe the Perſon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated to them in the Writ of <hi>Conge d'eſlire,</hi> and appoints how he ſhall be Conſecrated without <hi>Pall, Bulls, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things formerly requiſite to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the See of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Prerogative</hi> that our <hi>Kings</hi> now have in the <hi>Election of Biſhops,</hi> ſtands upon the foundation of this <hi>Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and other it has none. The <hi>Supreme Headſhip,</hi> it ſeems, did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the power of appointing <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> for that had been allow'd two Years ago, and is acknowledged by way of recital in this Seſſion, <hi>cap.</hi> 21. and yet the <hi>Election</hi> and Conſecration of <hi>Biſhops</hi> is appointed by <hi>Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament;</hi> ſo that the title of <hi>Supreme Head</hi> did not then imply any ſuch exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant

            <p>Next comes the Act entituled, <hi>No Impoſition ſhall be paid to the Biſhop of Rome,</hi> &amp;c. It recites, That <hi>where this your Grace's Realm, recogniſing no Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior under God, but only your Grace, hath been and is free from ſubjection to any Man's Law, but only to ſuch as have been deviſed, made and ordained within the ſame, for the Wealth of the ſaid Realm, or to ſuch other, as by ſufferance of your Grace and your Progenitors the People of this Realm have taken</hi> at their free Will and Liberty by their own Conſent <hi>to be uſed among them, and have bound themſelves by long uſe and cuſtom to the obſervance of the ſame, not as to the obſervance of the Laws of any foreign Prince, Potentate, or Prelate, but as to the accuſtomed and ancient Laws of this Realm originally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd as Laws of the ſame,</hi> by the ſaid ſufferance, conſent, and cuſtom, and <hi>none otherwiſe.</hi> Theſe <hi>other Laws,</hi> which the People of this Realm are ſaid to have taken <hi>at their free Will and Liberty, by their own Conſent,</hi> and are ſaid to have bound themſelves to, as to the Eſtabliſhed Laws of the Realm, <hi>by the ſaid ſufferance, conſent,

This would never have proceeded from them, if they had imagin'd, that the <hi>Legiſlative Power in Eccleſiaſtical Matters,</hi> was or ever had been veſted in the King's <hi>Perſon,</hi> as ſome <hi>amongſt</hi> us have not ſtuck to aſſert of late.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Act</hi> goes on; <hi>It ſtandeth therefore with natural equity and good Reaſon, that in all and every ſuch Laws humane, made within this Realm, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into this Realm,</hi> by the ſaid ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, conſent, and cuſtom, <hi>your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Majeſty,</hi> and your Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons, <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the whole ſtate of your Realm in this your moſt high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have full Power and Authority, not only</hi> to diſpenſe, <hi>but alſo to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize ſome Elect Perſon or Perſons, to</hi> diſpenſe <hi>with thoſe and all other

Here is no <hi>diſpenſing Power</hi> acknowledged to be <hi>perſonal</hi> in the <hi>King.</hi> Nor is the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſo much a ſtranger to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Religion,</hi> as not to have a ſhare even in the <hi>diſpenſing,</hi> as well as the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating</hi> Power, with reſpect to <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Laws.</hi> You ſee, as ſoon as ever the foreign Yoke was caſt off, they put in for their ſhare of the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> nor did the <hi>King</hi> look upon it as any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution to his own <hi>legal</hi> right, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their claim. It was in concurrence with them, and with <hi>their aſſent</hi> that the method of proſecuting <hi>Appeals</hi> had been ſettled; they joyn'd with him in tying up the hands of the <hi>Clergy</hi> from promulging any <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> without the <hi>Royal Aſſent;</hi> their Authority con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd in appointing how <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould be <hi>Elected, Inveſted, and Conſecrated;</hi> and here they impower the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> to grant <hi>Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:55049:64"/>
            <p>Then they proceed to Enact how, and by whom, and in what caſes <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations</hi> ſhall be granted for the future. And firſt they impower <hi>the Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>for the time being, and his Succeſſors to grant Diſpenſations to the King, his Heirs and Succeſſors, for cauſes not contrary to the Scriptures and the Laws of God.</hi> How?

            <p>The latter part of the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 21. concerns the <hi>viſiting</hi> of Colleges, Hoſpitals, and places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt.

            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:55049:66"/>
            <p>What was then meant, underſtood, recognis'd <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the word <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> will appear by theſe following Conſiderations; <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the <hi>Act</hi> ſhews they intended not by that recognition to inveſt him with any <hi>new</hi> Power: For they recite that the <hi>King's Majeſty juſtly and rightfully, is, and ought to be the Supreme head of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>and ſo is recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed by the Clergy of the Realm in their Convocations, yet nevertheleſs for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration and confirmation thereof,</hi> &amp;c. So that this <hi>Act</hi> ſo far forth, as it gives or acknowledges the Title of SUPREME HEAD, is but <hi>Declarative.</hi> And conſequently they, that upon this <hi>Act</hi> ground a Tranſlation of the <hi>Pope's</hi> Power by the <hi>Canon-law,</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> utterly miſtake the matter: For our <hi>King's Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> was not grounded upon the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> but the <hi>Common Law</hi> of the Realm; it was a Native of our own, and not of any foreign extraction: <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this <hi>Supreme Head-ſhip</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only in his being <hi>Supreme head</hi> of <hi>that Church of England,</hi> which then was called <hi>Anglicana Eccleſia;</hi> and who they were, appears <hi>Firſt,</hi> by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55049:67"/>of 24. <hi>Henr.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: <hi>The body Spiritual whereof</hi> (of the Realm of <hi>England</hi>) <hi>having Power, when any Cauſe of the Law Divine, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to come in queſtion, or of Spiritual Learning, that it was declared, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſhew'd by that part of the ſaid body Politick, called</hi> the Spiritualty; <hi>now being uſually called</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church. So that the Spiritualty are the <hi>Eccleſia Anglicana,</hi> of whom the <hi>King</hi> is here declar'd the <hi>ſupreme head. Secondly,</hi> It appears by the Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who having no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to declare a <hi>Supreme Head</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> matters for the <hi>Laity,</hi> did but by that Submiſſion acknowledge themſelves to be to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, the <hi>King</hi>'s Subjects and not the <hi>Pope</hi>'s. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This ſame <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> in this very Seſſion tells us, that the <hi>King</hi> had <hi>of right always been ſo:</hi> It is in the <hi>third Chapt. for the payment of firſt-fruits to the King.</hi> The words are, <hi>Wherefore his ſaid humble and obedient Subjects, as well the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as the Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>do pray that for the more ſurety, continuance, and augmentation of his Highneſs Royal
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55049:67"/>eſtate, being not only now recognis'd</hi> (as he always indeed hath heretofore been) <hi>the only</hi> Supreme Head <hi>in Earth, next and immediately under God,</hi> of the Church of England, <hi>but alſo</hi> their <hi>moſt aſſured and undoubted, natural Lord and King, having the whole Governance of this his Realm,</hi> &amp;c. They tell him, That he was <hi>not only</hi> the Supreme Head of the Church of <hi>England, but their</hi> (viz. the <hi>Temporalties</hi>) <hi>Lord and King;</hi> ſo that he had the <hi>Governance</hi> of the <hi>whole Realm</hi> and Subjects of the ſame. What can be more plain, than <hi>firſt,</hi> That by <hi>Supreme Head</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was meant the <hi>Supreme Head</hi> of the <hi>Spiritualty?</hi> which was neceſſary to be recogniz'd, becauſe they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged formerly another <hi>Supreme Head. Secondly,</hi> That they gave no new Power by that word, ſince they tell us, that <hi>indeed he had always been ſo.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That his <hi>Supremacy</hi> conſiſts only in a power of <hi>Governance. Fourthly,</hi> This title of <hi>Supreme Head</hi> does not give the <hi>King</hi> any power of <hi>diſpenſing</hi> with <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs whatſoever. That power was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55049:68"/>and Prieſts do execute their Paſtoral Office truly and faithfully, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe Points which by Chriſt and his Apoſtles were given and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them; and in caſe they ſhall be negligent in any part thereof, or would not diligently execute the ſame, to cauſe them to double and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their lack; and if they obſtinately withſtand their Prince's kind moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will not amend their faults, then and in ſuch caſe, to put others in their rooms and places: And God hath alſo commanded the ſaid Biſhops and Prieſts to obey with all humbleneſs and reverence, both Kings and Princes and Governors, and all their Laws not being contrary to the Laws of God) whatſoever they be, and that not only <hi>propter iram,</hi> but alſo <hi>prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſcientiam.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Thus it appears, that they both limited obedience to the King's Laws, with the due caution of not being contrary to the Law of God; and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction in diſcharge of the Paſtoral Office, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Paſtors of the Church by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and that the Supremacy then pretended to, was no
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55049:69"/>ſuch extravagant Power as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Sixthly,</hi> That the <hi>Supremacy</hi> aſcribed to the <hi>King</hi> by this <hi>Act,</hi> had no reference to any ſuch abſolute Power as the <hi>Pope</hi> pretended to, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the whole courſe of the <hi>King's Reign;</hi> foraſmuch as the Exerciſe of this <hi>Supremacy</hi> in every Branch of it, was directed by <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>poſitive Laws</hi> made much about the ſame time; nor perhaps were any Acts of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy exerted during this King's Reign, that ſome Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> or other did not warrant, as will appear in our Progreſs.</p>
            <p>The truth of it is, that no more can be made of it, than an utter Excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s pretended Authority, and an acknowledgment that the <hi>King</hi> is (not an abſolute <hi>Dominus fac-totum in Spiritualibus,</hi> but) the Fountain of Juſtice to be adminiſtred according to Law in Caſes commonly called <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> as well as <hi>Temporal,</hi> without any dependance upon a <hi>Foreign Potentate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is, that in theſe Acts of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth concerning <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Affairs, the Crown of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55049:69"/>
               <hi>England</hi> is ſo often mentioned to be an <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> and the <hi>Realm</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> an <hi>Empire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edward Hale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi>'s Caſe.</note> Tho that Word has been made uſe of of late to countenance a very ſtrange and unheard of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But the Gentleman that made uſe of the Word, either underſtood it not, or wilfully miſapplyed it. The Crown of <hi>England</hi> is ſaid to be an <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> becauſe it is ſubject to no <hi>Foreign Juriſdiction.</hi> The Kings of <hi>England</hi> are not <hi>Homagers</hi> nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were, for their Kingdom to any other, as many Kings have been. A <hi>Regal Crown</hi> does not <hi>ex vi termini,</hi> exclude a Subordination; an <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> does.

            <p>But it muſt be confeſs'd, that the Word <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> tho legally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, it be no ſuch Bug-bear, yet was a Term borrowed from <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> a Word that gave offence, eſpecially to thoſe that knew little of its Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, but what they had learnt from a Juriſdiction pretended to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55049:70"/>by the Pope as ſuch; and claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſo, as <hi>Vicar General</hi> to <hi>Chriſt. Papiſts</hi> thought the Right of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor injuriouſly invaded; and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> though univerſally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the Legal Power of the Crown, yet many of them boggl'd at the Title, as making too bold with our <hi>Saviours</hi> Prerogative of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only <hi>HEAD</hi> of the Church. And ſo great Powers were given to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth by <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> (of which by and by) in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Matters; which, though given by particular <hi>Laws,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> occaſion'd by the then Circumſtances of Affairs; yet by ſome unadviſed Perſons are confounded with his <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Original Supremacy</hi> at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> or at leaſt are lookt upon as incident to the <hi>Title, Style,</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>Supreme Head;</hi> that no wonder the Title has found little countenance from Proteſtant Writers.</p>
            <p>The other part of this ſhort Act of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and diſcovers a Secret that few obſerve; but rightly conſidered, lays
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55049:70"/>open a very fine Scene, and gives an undeniable Anſwer to the only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Argument that can be produced in favor of the late <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> The Argument lies thus: King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth iſſued a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> whereby he conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Matters, and delegated to him the Exerciſe of all his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> long before the 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which impowered Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Succeſſors from time to time, to iſſue ſuch Commiſſions: And this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Cromwell</hi> cannot be deny'd to have been a Legal Commiſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is recited in an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

How far the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:55049:72"/>gives countenance thereunto, ſhall be enquired into when we come to it.</p>
            <p>The next Act that I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, is the Thirteenth Chapter of this ſame Seſſion, entituled, <hi>By whom Suffragans ſhall be nominated and elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> The Act recites, that <hi>ſithen the beginning of this preſent Parliament, good and honourable Laws and Statutes have been made and eſtabliſhed for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, Preſentations, Conſecrations, and inveſting of Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of this Realm, with all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies appertaining to the ſame; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, no Proviſion hath been made for Suffragan Biſhops;</hi> and therefore enacts, what <hi>Towns ſhall be taken and accepted for Sees of Biſhops Suffragans:</hi> And gives the King <hi>Power and Authority to give to one of two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be preſented to him by any Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop or Biſhop, the Stile, Title and Name of a Biſhop of ſuch a See,</hi> &amp;c. provides <hi>for the Conſecration of ſuch Biſhops;</hi> limits <hi>what Authority they ſhall have in the Dioceſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

He had it not before, for then there would have been no need of the <hi>Act.</hi> It is greater to give than to receive.

            <p>The next Act is that of <hi>Marriages; cap.</hi> 38. of this Seſſion, the Conuſance of <hi>Marriage</hi> had time out of mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the <hi>Spiritual Juriſdiction;</hi> which was now veſted in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the <hi>King's Perſon;</hi> the executive part he might adminiſter by Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners delegated, by vertue of the Stat. of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. (as hath been ſaid) a <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power was given him by 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 26.

            <head>An Anſwer to CHAP. 4. SECT. 1. Of a late BOOK, Entituled, the <hi>King's Viſitatorial Power Aſſerted,</hi> By way of APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>SInce the foregoing Papers were Written, a late Mercenary Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, One <hi>Nathaniel Johnſon,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in Phyſick, has publiſh'd a Book, Entituled, <hi>The King's Viſitatorial Power, Aſſerted;</hi> in which Book he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted a long Section (how pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55049:84"/>to his main deſign, in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, may perhaps be ſhewn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) <hi>concerning the King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Power in Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, and Viſitations,</hi> page 144. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to page 160.</p>
            <p>In which Section, becauſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſet up an imaginary <hi>Perſonal Supremacy,</hi> quite different from what I have endeavoured to aſſert from ſome Remarks, upon <hi>Ancient Hiſtories,</hi> and <hi>late Acts of Parliament,</hi> but agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough with ſome Opinions that have been eſpous'd of late, and made uſe of to warrant ſome late Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I thought it might not be amiſs to trace him through that <hi>Section,</hi> and ſubmit to the Judgment of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Reader, whether the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> has afforded the World a right Scheme of the King's <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beg the Reader's Pardon, if he meet with ſome few paſſages over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain here, that were touch'd upon in the foregoing Diſcourſe. I hope their uſefulneſs will excuſe the repetition of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55049:84"/>them; and the Anſwer would not have been ſo clear without it.</p>
            <p>He tells us (<hi>pag.</hi> 144.) that <hi>long before the Reformation, ſeveral Kings of</hi> England <hi>permitted no Canons, or Conſtitutions of the Church, or Bulls and Breves of the Apoſtolick See, to be executed here</hi> [without their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.] Which I agree to be very true, only the Doctor ſaying <hi>[with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Allowance]</hi> implies (and it appears by the whole drift of his Diſcourſe in this Chapter, and indeed by the main Scope of his Book, that he would be underſtood) that <hi>With their Allowance</hi> ſuch <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, Bulls</hi> and <hi>Breves</hi> might lawfully be Executed. Which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: And hope to make it evident, that <hi>Our Kings</hi> could not by their own <hi>Perſonal Authority</hi> let in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Subjects a <hi>foreign</hi> Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>He adds (<hi>pag.</hi> 145.) that <hi>ſince the Supremacy has been Eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament in the Crown, The Kings of</hi> England <hi>may according to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55049:85"/>Laws in force, not only Exerciſe all the Powers they could,
<note n="*" place="margin">What Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thoſe are, no Man knows but <hi>Filmer, Brady, Johnſon, Hicks,</hi> Sir. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger L'Eſtrange,</hi> and a very few others of ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday.</note> as Sovereign Princes; but likewiſe whatever the Pope</hi> de jure, <hi>if not</hi> de facto <hi>could, or did do, in the outward Regiment of Eccleſiaſtical matters; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</hi> that <hi>whatſoever was done</hi> in Viſitations <hi>by the Authority of the Popes, Metropolitans, or Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, may now be done by the Kings of</hi> England, <hi>as Supreme Ordinaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is a very wild Aſſertion, and without the leaſt Foundation of Truth. He does not here ſpeak it out roundly, <hi>That the King may by the Law do whatever the Pope</hi> de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto <hi>did;</hi> but minces the matter a little by ſaying, <hi>Whatever the Pope</hi> de jure, [<hi>if not</hi> de facto] <hi>could, or did do:</hi> And, yet with the ſame breath, he ſays poſitively, that <hi>whatever was done</hi> in Viſitations <hi>by Authority of the Pope, may now be done by the King.</hi> So that however <hi>the King</hi> may be limited, and tyed up in other Parts of his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction,</hi> to what the Popes <hi>de jure</hi> could do, <hi>in Viſitations,</hi> at leaſt he has Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55049:85"/>to do whatever the <hi>Popes, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi> actually <hi>did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Doctor</hi> did not conſider that the ſeveral Branches of <hi>the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> now reſtored <hi>by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> are guided, directed, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by poſitive and particular Laws, made about the time of the Reformation: And that the Act of <hi>primo Elizabeth,</hi> in that general Clauſe, which Reſtores <hi>the Supremacy, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nites and Annexes</hi> only <hi>ſuch Juriſdiction, and Authority, as had, or might be</hi> lawfully <hi>Exerciſed by any Spiritual Perſon,</hi> &amp;c. Not that the <hi>Pope</hi> (to ſpeak ſtrictly) could Exerciſe any Juriſdiction <hi>lawfully</hi> within this Realm, for the Old Laws and Cuſtoms of the Realm, and the Statutes of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire</hi> and <hi>Proviſors</hi> were firm Bars to his Right; but a Juriſdiction may be <hi>lawful</hi> in it ſelf (that is (for ſo I would be underſtood) the Acts of a Perſon Aſſuming Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, may be <hi>lawful</hi> in themſelves) conſidered ſeparate and a-part from <hi>the Perſon</hi> of him that Exerts it; though <hi>the Perſon</hi> Exerciſing ſuch Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55049:86"/>have no <hi>legal</hi> Authority. If an Uſurper ſhould poſſeſs himſelf of any Government, and carry on the Adminiſtration of it, in the ſame Method and Courſe of Juſtice, that the <hi>Lawful Prince</hi> did, or ought to do, in ſtrictneſs of Law there might perhaps be a Nullity in all his Acts; and yet, conſidered Abſtracted from <hi>his Perſon,</hi> his Government would be ſaid to be <hi>lawful;</hi> that is, according to Law, and the courſe of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that had been ſetled, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained before his Uſurpation. So, whatever <hi>the Pope</hi> did in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as pretending to be <hi>Head of the Engliſh Church,</hi> which was not in it ſelf contrary to the <hi>Law</hi> of the Realm in Church, or State; but might <hi>lawfully</hi> be done, though not by him, is by the ſaid Act of <hi>primo Elizabeth, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited and Annexed,</hi> to what? Why, <hi>to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi> Whereas <hi>by the Act of Supremacy</hi> that paſſed in <hi>King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighths</hi> time, <hi>All ſuch Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Authority,</hi> &amp;c. was <hi>perſonally</hi> veſted in <hi>the King, his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</hi> But of that diſtinction more
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55049:86"/>ſhall be ſaid, God willing, ſome other time.</p>
            <p>Purſuant to this imagination of the <hi>Pope's</hi> Power, being Tranſlated to <hi>the King,</hi> he tells us, that <hi>latter Laws have devolved upon the King even the Power of the Pope</hi> in foro ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno, <hi>pag.</hi> 145.</p>
            <p>He ſays (<hi>pag.</hi> 145, 146.) that <hi>during the Schiſm</hi> (in the Papacy between <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi>) <hi>King</hi> William Rufus <hi>claimed as other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did, a Right to declare to which Pope he would adhere:</hi> And that <hi>none ſhould be received, as Pope, in</hi> England, <hi>without his Licence and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Here if I underſtand <hi>the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> aright, he takes for granted, that if there ſhould happen a <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the <hi>Popedom,</hi> the King might declare whether, or which of the Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors himſelf thought fit, to be <hi>Pope</hi> within this Realm. Which I deny that he could do, without the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the <hi>Clergy and Laity</hi> in a General Aſſembly.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:55049:87"/>
            <p>He ſays (<hi>pag.</hi> 145.) that, <hi>if the Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>called, and preſided in a General Council of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> King William <hi>allowed nothing to be appointed, or forbidden, unleſs they were accommodated to his Will, and were firſt ordained by him.</hi> Theſe are the Words of <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> out of whom <hi>the Doctor</hi> Quotes them: (<hi>Eadm. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Fol.</hi> 6.) But if <hi>the Doctor</hi> would here inſinuate, as he does, and conſonantly to his own <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> muſt mean, that the <hi>King's Will</hi> concurring with the Aſſent of <hi>a General Council of Biſhops,</hi> could make an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Law</hi> to bind the whole Kingdom, without the <hi>Aſſent of the Laity,</hi> that is what I deny; and hope to make it very clear in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Whereas he ſays (<hi>pag.</hi> 145.) out of the ſame Author <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> that <hi>King</hi> William <hi>ſuffered not any of his Barons, or Officers to undergo any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Cenſure, but by his precept.</hi> I hope it will appear, that this was not an Arbitrary Power aſſumed by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55049:87"/>the King, but that the Law of the Realm was ſo.</p>
            <p>He ſays (<hi>pag.</hi> 146, 147.) that <hi>the Oath of Fidelity, which</hi> Anſelme <hi>had taken to King</hi> William Rufus, <hi>was no ways like the preſent Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſays (<hi>pag.</hi> 148, 149.) <hi>As to the legantine Power, it is apparent by ſeveral Inſtances, that none Exerciſed any here without the</hi> King's <hi>leave.</hi> Which is true, and as true it is, and apparent by as many Inſtances, that the <hi>King ſingly</hi> could not give any ſuch leave.</p>
            <p>He ſays (<hi>pag.</hi> 154.) that <hi>What Viſitations were made of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Oxford <hi>by the</hi> Pope's Legates, <hi>do no ways infer that thereby the</hi> King's <hi>Power of</hi> Viſiting <hi>is Exauctorated, but that whatever they did was in Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the King's pleaſure, or as ordain'd by his Laws.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi> does well to disjoin the <hi>King's Pleaſure</hi> and his <hi>Laws,</hi> for they did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways agree. But this <hi>Paragraph</hi> muſt
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55049:88"/>be altered to make it tolerable Sence; viz. <hi>Whatever the legates did in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Oxford, <hi>if it were not contrary to the King's Laws, was in Subordination to the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some other paſſages tending to the ſame purpoſe, with thoſe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken notice of, will offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as we go along through the ſeveral parts of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>Whereas the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays, that <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kings permitted no Canons, or Conſtitutions of the Church, or Bulls,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be Executed here</hi> [without their Allowance:] Intimating thereby that thoſe Kings might of their own <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Authority</hi> give ſuch <hi>Allowance,</hi> And that <hi>[with their Allowance]</hi> Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> might be Executed here; I take leave to ſay, That it never was in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> legally to Subject his People to a Foreign Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, nor to Oblige them to the Obſervance of any Law, without their own <hi>Aſſent:</hi> And therefore <hi>the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55049:88"/>King's Allowance</hi> could not make a Foreign <hi>Canon</hi> Obligatory here, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were received by the People with their own <hi>Aſſent:</hi> Nor could his giving leave, legally Subject his People to Proceſſes from <hi>Rome,</hi> as will abundantly appear by and by.</p>
            <p>But before I go on, I deſire the <hi>Doctor</hi> to take notice of an Old <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> (for ſuch it was, though the Word <hi>Parliament</hi> was not then in being amongſt us) made in King <hi>Edward the Confeſſor's</hi> Time, if not before, and Confirmed by King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the Firſt: Debet Rex omnia ritè facere in Regno &amp;</hi> [per Judicium Procerum Regni.] <hi>Debet enim Jus &amp; Juſtitia magis regnare in Regno, quàm</hi> voluntas prava. <hi>Lex eſt ſemper quod jus facit: Voluntas autem, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia &amp; Vis non eſt Jus.</hi> And again in the ſame <hi>Chapter; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Rex Judicium Rectum in Regno facere, &amp; Juſtitiam</hi> [per Conſilium Procerum Regni ſui tenere.] <hi>Iſta verò debet omnia Rex in propriâ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonâ, inſpectis &amp; tactis Sacroſanctis Evangeliis, &amp; ſuper ſacras &amp; ſanctas

            <p>It was an Old Rule of Law in this Nation, the very Foundation upon which our Government is

            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> tells us (<hi>pag.</hi> 145.) out of <hi>Eadmerus, Lib. primo, pag.</hi> 6. That <hi>King</hi> William <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror introduc'd this here, That none in his Dominions ſhould own the Pope, but by his Command, Nor

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban.</hi> Now whereas the Government, as to the Eſſential parts of it, was in King <hi>William the Conqueror's</hi> Time, the ſame that it is now, ſaving ſome Inroads that have ſince been made by the <hi>Prerogative;</hi> And whereas in times ſubſequent to his, the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> determined who ſhould be received as <hi>Pope,</hi> and who not; And ſince there is nothing more common with the <hi>Monks,</hi> than to mention things as done by Our <hi>Kings,</hi> which were either <hi>Judicial Acts</hi> of their <hi>Courts,</hi> or done by them in their <hi>Great Councils,</hi> and conſequently were <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> (of which ſome Inſtances will be given hereafter in this Diſcourſe) upon what Grounds can any rational Man conceive otherwiſe, than that the Conſtitution afore-mentioned to be made by King <hi>William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,</hi> was <hi>a Law,</hi> or an <hi>Act of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55049:96"/>Parliament</hi> made in his Time, And that his <hi>Commanding</hi> who ſhould be owned as <hi>Pope</hi> within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, was to be a Command by him in <hi>Parliament;</hi> ſince the Law in his Time was ſuch, That the King was to do all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick things no otherwiſe, than <hi>per Judicium &amp; Conſilium Procerum Regni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Complaint of <hi>Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus,</hi> is, That <hi>None ſhould receive the Pope's Letters, unleſs they were firſt ſhewed to him.</hi> By which if Letters of <hi>Proviſion</hi> only are meant; I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them hereafter. If all <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> and <hi>Proceſs</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> be meant, then was not this introduced by <hi>King William,</hi> for that the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of <hi>Bulls, Citations, Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Faculties, Diſpenſations, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,</hi> &amp;c. from <hi>Rome,</hi> was in thoſe Days, and antecedent to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, contrary to Law, and in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the <hi>Rights of the Crown,</hi> and the <hi>Liberties of the People:</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:55049:96"/>Nor could the ſhewing them to the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Perſonal Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> or <hi>Allowance,</hi> give them any <hi>Legal</hi> Authority within this Kingdom, and conſequently the Concurrence of the Great Council muſt be here underſtood, though not expreſſed by the <hi>Monk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third is, That <hi>If the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>called and preſided in a General Synod of the Biſhops, he allowed nothing to be Appointed, or Forbidden, unleſs they were accommodated to his Will, and were firſt Ordain'd by him.</hi> Which is ſuch another Law, as that of the <hi>Twenty fifth of King Henry the Eighth, cap.</hi> 19. That <hi>the Clergy ſhall not preſume to Attempt, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Claim, or put in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re any Conſtitutions, or Ordinances, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, or Synodal, or any other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, nor Enact, Promulge, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute any ſuch Canons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in their Convocations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>without the King's Aſſent.</hi> This Law of <hi>King Henry the Eighth,</hi> was not Introductory
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55049:97"/>of a new Law; for there <hi>the King's Humble and Obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Clergy of this Realm of</hi> England <hi>acknowledged</hi> [Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Truth,] <hi>that the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the ſame Clergy, are, always have been, and ought to be Aſſembled by the King's Writ:</hi> And that their <hi>Promiſe in</hi> verbo ſacerdotii <hi>that from thenceforth they would not preſume to Attempt, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, Claim, or put in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re, Enact, Promulge, or Execute any New Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Conſtitutions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>unleſs the King's moſt Royal Aſſent and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence may to them be had,</hi> &amp;c. was but in Affirmance of the Old Law of the Realm, even before King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror's Reign, appears abundantly by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s <hi>Councils,</hi> where (I think) no Eccleſiaſtical Laws appear to have been made without the <hi>King's Aſſent</hi> before the Conqueſt, nor for ſome Reigns after.</p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:55049:97"/>
            <p>His Fourth Complaint, is, That <hi>He would not ſuffer any of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, or Officers to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndergo any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Cenſure, but by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi> This was afterwards One of the Laws of <hi>Clarendon.

            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 145, 146, 147.) relates the Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Anſelm</hi> in ſuch a manner, as <hi>If the Epiſcopi, Abbates &amp; Principes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gni</hi> had had no more to do in it, than to carry Meſſages betwixt him and the King.

            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> tells us (<hi>pag.</hi> 146.) that <hi>When in the ſame King's Reign, the Archbiſhop was Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to have leave to go to</hi> Rome, <hi>and Viſit the Succeſſor of St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>for the being better Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Government of the Church; he received Anſwer from the King, That if he went he ſhould for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain know, that he would ſeize his whole Archbiſhoprick into his Hands, nor would he receive him for Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop any more, like as now the Writ</hi> Ne Exeat Regnum <hi>is uſed with a Penalty ſpecified.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> went beyond Sea, and the <hi>King</hi> was as good as his Word. This the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays, <hi>may be a document to ſome, not obſtinately to oppoſe their Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, if by the Law of the Land, no <hi>Archbiſhop, Biſhop,</hi> or other <hi>Great Man,</hi> might depart the Realm without the <hi>King's</hi> leave, then did <hi>Anſelm</hi>'s contempt

            </p>
            <p>If any Man depart the <hi>Realm</hi> at this Day, after a Writ of <hi>Ne Exeat Regnum</hi> ſerved upon him, he becomes <hi>a Fugitive,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> may ſeize his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> as he did the <hi>Archbiſhops Temporalities.</hi> And yet we have no <hi>Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> for this now upon <hi>Record,</hi> but Cuſtom Time out of Mind, which we call <hi>Common-Law.</hi> Yet among the Laws of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> this is one;</p>

This was no other than the Modern <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> without any material difference. The Archbiſhop did not pretend that the Laws of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> as Wicked and Unjuſt as he might think them, were any other than Explanations and Aſſertions of the <hi>Ancient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages</hi> of the Realm.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55049:103"/>made by <hi>Acts of Parliament;</hi> by which if Men had been content to ſtand or fall, many Notions, that are now too riſe amongſt us, would never have been hatched.</p>
            <p>The Writ from <hi>R. de Glanville</hi> to the Abbot of <hi>Battle</hi> (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the <hi>Doctor pag.</hi> 148.) whereby he Commands him on the <hi>King's</hi> behalf, by the Faith which he owed him, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Cauſe that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending betwixt the Monks of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the <hi>Archbiſhop, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec indè mecum fueris locutus,</hi> was no other than a <hi>Probibition</hi> to him to proceed in a Cauſe depending before him, and the Abbots of <hi>Feverſham</hi> and <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi> as Judges appointed by the <hi>Pope</hi> to hear and determine it. They had cited the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> to appear before them, they had ſent him <hi>Comminatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Epiſtolam, eique diem peremptorium praefixerant.</hi> They had no <hi>Legal Authority</hi> to Exerciſe Juriſdiction within the Realm; for the <hi>Pope</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:55049:104"/>could give them none: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> prohibits them in the <hi>King's</hi> Name. The Writ may be Read in <hi>Chron. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas. Coll. pag.</hi> 1503. from whence the <hi>Doctor</hi> Quotes the Story: Though he relates it Knaviſhly enough. <hi>We find a Writ</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the Abbot of Battle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wherein he Commands him on the part of the King, by the Faith which he owes him, and by the Oath, which he made to him, to do what he then enjoyned.</hi> Never telling us that the thing enjoyn'd, was the keeping of his <hi>Oath,</hi> and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Law,</hi> and that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod obſerved by the <hi>King</hi> in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him this <hi>Injunction,</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ordinary courſe of Juſtice, and of proceedings at Law in the like Caſes. But the <hi>Doctor</hi> would raiſe a little Duſt by this, and a few other ſuch pitiful Scraps, to amuſe his Readers, and create an Opinion that the <hi>King</hi> may enjoyn any thing.</p>
            <pb n="203" facs="tcp:55049:104"/>
            <p>As to the <hi>Legantine Power</hi> (he ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 148.) <hi>It is apparent by ſeveral Inſtances, that none Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any here without the King's leave, whether by the Grant of Pope</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas <hi>to</hi> Edward <hi>the Confeſſor, he diſputes not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Doctor</hi> takes for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>with the King's leave</hi> a a <hi>Legate</hi> might be ſent and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Office here. Though what he Quotes for it out of <hi>Eadmerus pag.</hi> 125, 126. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what paſſed betwixt King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Firſt,</hi> and <hi>Pope Calixtus</hi> at <hi>Giſors,</hi> makes nothing for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>Rex à Papa impetravit, ut omnes Conſuetudines, quas Pater ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in Angliâ habuerat &amp; in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manniâ, ſibi concederet, &amp; maximè ut neminem aliquando legati Officio in Angliâ fungi permitteret, ſi non ipſe, aliquâ praecipuâ querelâ exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente, &amp; quae ab Archiepiſcopo Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuariorum, caeteriſque Epiſcopis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gni terminari non poſſet, hoc fieri
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55049:105"/>à Papâ poſtularet.</hi> The coming in of a <hi>Legate</hi> at the <hi>King's</hi> Requeſt, to determine ſome great and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Controverſie in particular, which could not be decided by all the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> is one thing; and the coming in of a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> with a General Power to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Juriſdiction over all the <hi>King's</hi> Subjects, and to hold a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine Court is a quite other thing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays (<hi>pag.</hi> 151.) that <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1138, <hi>&amp; Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Regis Stephan.</hi> Albert or Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric <hi>Cardinal of</hi> Hoſtia, <hi>was the Pope's Legate and Conſecrated</hi> Theobald <hi>Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Clergy to a</hi> Colloquium <hi>by Apoſtolical Authority, by which it appears,</hi> ſays he, <hi>That the Canons of the Church now obtained, and the King Aſſented to the Powers the Legate had, ſo that what was Decreed had the King's Allowance.</hi> It ſeems, provided what was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed had the <hi>King's Allowance,</hi> all
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55049:105"/>was well, and there needed no more. But <hi>Gerv. Dorobern. Coll. pag.</hi> 1344. tells us that <hi>Praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Albericus Apoſtolicâ Legatione functus venit in Angliam, Domini Papae litteras ad Regem deferens; lectis itaque litteris</hi> coram Rege &amp; Primoribus Angliae, <hi>licèt non in primis, vix tandèm pro Reverentiâ Domini Papae ſuſceptus eſt.</hi> So that this <hi>Legate</hi> was admitted by the Conſent of the <hi>Primores Angliae,</hi> as well as of the <hi>King.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, his Exerciſing his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice here, with ſuch <hi>Aſſent,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, is no Argument, that the <hi>King's Perſonal Aſſent</hi> to his Powers, without the Concurrence of his <hi>Primores,</hi> would have made them ever a whit the better. And when this <hi>Legate</hi> Celebrated his <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> there were preſent <hi>Epiſcopi diverſarum Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciarum, Numero XVII, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates ferè XXX, &amp; Cleri &amp; Populi Multitudo Numeroſa.</hi> See <hi>Spelman's Councils, Volume the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, pag.</hi> 39. and <hi>Gerv.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55049:106"/>Collect. pag.</hi> 1347. So that as the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the <hi>Primores</hi> was had to his Entry, ſo the <hi>Multitudo Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſa Cleri &amp; Populi Aſſented</hi> to the <hi>Canons</hi> then made.

The <hi>Doctor's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> miſtake is, in calling this an Aſſembly of the <hi>Clergy:</hi> For, though this Council was Aſſembled for <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Matters,</hi> nor do we find any Temporal Laws made, or Temporal Affairs tranſacted in it,

            <p>What follows in the <hi>Doctor</hi> (p. 156, 157) concerning the <hi>King's Temporal Courts, being Judges, whether a Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Juriſdiction of the Temporal or Eccleſiaſtical Courts,</hi> is very true: And ſo is the Account, that he gives of King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Firſt, his ſettling ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars to belong to the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eccleſiaſtical Judges, in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at</hi> Illibon <hi>in</hi> Normandy, <hi>Anno</hi> 1080. But it is an inveterate Error of the <hi>Doctor's,</hi> to confound the <hi>King's perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Authority</hi> with his Authority in his <hi>Courts,</hi> and his Authority in, and with the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of his <hi>Great Councils</hi> or <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi> That Councel of <hi>Illebon,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by the <hi>Doctor,</hi> is related by <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericus Vitalis</hi> in this manner; <hi>viz.

            <p>Then the <hi>Doctor</hi> refers his Readers for farther ſatisfaction how far the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have exerciſed Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical matters,</hi> to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55049:126"/>Sir <hi>Roger Twiſelen,</hi> pag. 108, 109, &amp;c. who inſtanceth in <hi>eighteen</hi> particulars.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, <hi>that they permitted none to be taken for Pope, but by the King's appointment.</hi> For which he quotes <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> pag. 26. But of this matter having ſpoken already, I ſhall ſay no more of it in this place.</p>
            <p>The Second is, <hi>That none were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Letters from the Pope, without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the King, who cauſed all words prejudicial to him or his Crown, to be renounced.</hi> For which he quotes <hi>Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus,</hi> pag. 113. In whom are theſe words, in a Letter from Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, <hi>viz. Sedis eni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55049:126"/>ſum Regiae Majeſtatis, nullam in poteſtate tuâ ſuſceptionem aut aditum promerentur.</hi> This was but the Law of <hi>England,</hi> not to be ſubject to any <hi>Foreign</hi> Power; aſſerted by a Law in King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi>'s time, and afterwards over and over in oppoſition to <hi>Papal</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments and Uſurpations; confirm'd by the Statutes of <hi>Praemunire</hi> and <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> and effectually ſecured by the <hi>Laws</hi> made at and ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and particularly by that Remarkable Statute of 14 <hi>Henr.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. concerning Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals. And that the King could not of himſelf let in a <hi>Forein</hi> Power upon his People, appears ſufficiently by what has been ſaid already. The two Paſſages quoted by Sir <hi>Roger</hi> out of <hi>Thorn, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</hi> pag. 2151, 2152, and 2194, ſhew that two Perſons, to whom the <hi>Pope</hi> had conferr'd by <hi>Proviſions,</hi> the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> were enforced, before their Admittance, to <hi>renounce all ſuch words in their Bulls of Proviſion,</hi> as were prejudicial to the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Crown; i.e.</hi> to the <hi>Laws of the Realm,</hi> in and over which the King was Supreme Magiſtrate and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. After which <hi>renunciation</hi> made, they did <hi>fealty</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and were
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55049:127"/>by the <hi>Eſcheator</hi> put into poſſeſſion of their <hi>Temporalties.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> might by Law have oppos'd theſe <hi>Proviſions,</hi> but the <hi>Monks,</hi> who had the Right of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> being willing to receive the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo <hi>collated,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> to admit them (as any Private <hi>Patron</hi> might admit a Clerk to be collated to a Church of his own Gift, by <hi>Proviſion)</hi> it was very reaſonable that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould require a <hi>renunciation</hi> of ſuch Clauſes in their <hi>Bulls of Proviſion,</hi> as interſer'd with the Juriſdiction, which the <hi>Law</hi> gave him over his <hi>Spiritual Subjects.</hi> And this appears by Sir <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi>'s third quotation upon this Head, compar'd with an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> time.</p>
            <p>The quotation is out of <hi>Coke</hi>'s 3 <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit.</hi> pag. 27. where the Form of the <hi>Renunciation</hi> is ſet down; <hi>viz. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all the words comprized in the Pope's Bull to me made of the Abby of,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the which be contrary or prejudicial to the King our Sovereign Lord, and to his Crown,</hi> &amp;c. A true and Gonuine Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of which, take from an <hi>Act</hi> of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Be it Enacted by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this preſent Parliament, That all
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55049:127"/>Bulls, Diſpenſations and Privileges ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained before the Twentieth Year of King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> Eighth, <hi>or which ſhall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be obtained of the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>not containing matter contrary or prejudicial to</hi> [the Authority, Dignity, or Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence Royal or Imperial of the Realm, or to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Realm,] <hi>now being in force, may be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. So that ſuch <hi>Bulls,</hi> as were not contrary to the known <hi>Laws</hi> of the Realm, were allowed to be valid, ſo long as the <hi>Pope</hi> was acknowledged to be the <hi>Head of the Engliſh Church:</hi> But ſuch <hi>Bulls,</hi> or <hi>clauſes in Bulls,</hi> as were contrary to the <hi>Laws,</hi> were to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,</hi> as Prejudicial to our Sovereign Lord the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Crown; i. e.</hi> as this Law of <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> explains it; <hi>to the Preheminence Imperial of the Realm, and the Laws of the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s third Particular is, That <hi>Our Kings permitted No Councils, but by their liking, to aſſemble, which gained the name of Convocations; as that always had been and ought to be aſſembled by the King's Writ.</hi> For this Sir <hi>Roger</hi> quotes <hi>Eadmer. pag.</hi> 24, and the ſtatute of 25 <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19. Upon this Head I have no Controverſie with the <hi>Doctor</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:55049:128"/>nor Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> I only aſſert, that ſuch things as are the proper Buſineſs of <hi>Convocations,</hi> cannot be tranſacted by the <hi>King alone</hi> without them.</p>
            <p>His fourth particular is, That <hi>Our Kings cauſed ſome to ſit in them (ſc.</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Councils) <hi>to ſuperviſe their Actions and prohibit them, on the behalf of the King and Kingdom,</hi> ne quid ibi contra Regiam Coronam aut dignitation ſtatuere attentarent. Here the Reader is to obſerve, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority quoted for this, is in <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1237. which was about the twentieth year of King <hi>Henry the Third,</hi> before which time the <hi>Clergy</hi> had turn'd the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Laity</hi> out of their <hi>Synods.</hi> And therefore it ſtood the <hi>King</hi> in ſtead to <hi>prohibit</hi> them, who were but a ſmall number of his Subjects, and ſcarce <hi>half-Subjects,</hi> from attempting any thing to the prejudice of the Rights of his <hi>Crown,</hi> or the <hi>Liberties</hi> of his People, and the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Realm; which they had already made too great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes upon. As no ſuch <hi>Prohibitions</hi> as theſe, can be produc'd in former times, ſo they were altogether uſeleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, when the <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves and <hi>all</hi> ſuch of their Subjects as were
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55049:128"/>admitted into <hi>Parliaments,</hi> ſat and had Votes in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Synods:</hi> as is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably evident by almoſt all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Councils</hi> collected by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> till within the Reign of King <hi>Steven;</hi> Who owing his Crown to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> was fain to ſuffer this and other Uſurpations, to ſecure his crack'd Title. But after the <hi>Clergy</hi> took upon them to meet in <hi>Convocations,</hi> neither aſſembled by the <hi>Kings Writ,</hi> nor conſiſting, as the <hi>Ancient</hi> Synods had done, of the <hi>King</hi> and all the <hi>Eſtates of the Realm, Prohibitions</hi> to them are frequent, not to attempt any thing againſt the <hi>Law of the Land.

But I lay no ſtreſs at all upon the <hi>Parliament</hi>'s being here a party. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this Writ only to confirm Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>'s fourth particular of the <hi>Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> to attempt any thing againſt the Rights of his <hi>Crown</hi> or the <hi>Law</hi> of the Land. It is a known Rule, that whatever is forbidden by <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> may forbid by his <hi>Proclamation;</hi> and that whenſoever any Court aſſumes an Authority, not warranted by <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> may <hi>prohibite</hi> them by his <hi>Writ.</hi> What more natural, then for the <hi>ſupreme Magistrate,</hi> to whom the <hi>Law</hi> has committed the <hi>Execution</hi> of it ſelf, to <hi>prohibite</hi> all things that are contrary to <hi>Law?</hi>

            <pb n="251" facs="tcp:55049:129"/>
            <p>As here we ſee the <hi>King,</hi> at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitas,</hi> prohibits the <hi>Clergy</hi> from attempting any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Conſuetudo Regni,</hi> ſo in King <hi>Henry the Eighth's time</hi> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a prohibition to the <hi>King</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the <hi>Clergy,</hi> not to do any thing <hi>contrariant or repugnant to the King's prerogative Royal, or the Customs, Laws and Statutes of the Realm.</hi> The Statute of 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. (which all men agree to be but <hi>declarative</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law)</hi> enacts that <hi>No Canons, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions or Ordinances of the Clergy, ſhall be [made] or put in Execution within this Realm by Authority of the Convocation of the Clergy, which ſhall be contrariant or repugnant to the Kings prerogative Royal, or the Customs, Laws, or Statutes of the Realm.</hi> This <hi>Act</hi> had before provided, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> ſhould not <hi>make, promulge or execute any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Constitutions or Ordinances in their Convocations without the Kings Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Aſſent,</hi> under the Penalty of a <hi>Premunire;</hi> ſo that without the <hi>Kings Aſſent</hi> their <hi>Canons</hi> would be Nullities, and themſelves under a <hi>premunire</hi> for <hi>making</hi> or <hi>Executing</hi> them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the <hi>Act</hi> provides in an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clauſe,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55049:130"/>that they ſhall <hi>[make]</hi> no <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, &amp;c. contrary to the Kings prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, or the Laws of the Realm,</hi> this is a <hi>prohibition</hi> to the <hi>King and them</hi> not to make any ſuch <hi>Canons, Conſtitutions</hi> or <hi>Ordinances,</hi> as are contrary to <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s fifth particular is, That <hi>our Kings ſuffered no ſynodical decree to be of force, but by their Allowance and Confirmation.</hi> For which he quotes <hi>Florentius Wigornenſis, Anno</hi> 1127. Where 'tis ſaid, <hi>Rex auditis Concilii Geſtis, conſenſum praebuit, &amp; authoritate Regia &amp; potestate conceſſit &amp; confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit statuta Concilii à Gulielmo Cantuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſi Archiepiſcopo &amp; ſanctae Romanae Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae legato apud Westmonaſterium cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brati.</hi> Now that <hi>Council</hi> conſiſted not of the <hi>Clergy</hi> only, but as <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Synods did in thoſe days, of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity; Confluxerunt quoque illic magnae multitudines Clericorum &amp; Laico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, tam divitum quam mediocrium, &amp; fact us est conventus grandis &amp; ineſtimabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. ibidem.</hi> And this we have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> was neceſſary, <hi>quatenus quicquid ejuſmodi Concilii Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate decerneretur, utriuſque Ordinis cura &amp; ſollicitudine ratum ſervaretur.</hi> Now, that the Acts of ſuch Synods
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55049:130"/>were of no force within the Realm without the <hi>Kings Aſſent,</hi> I agree: as his <hi>Aſſent</hi> is neceſſary to make an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> a binding <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> ſo his <hi>Aſſent</hi> is, and till the <hi>Clergy</hi> had turn'd him out of their <hi>Synods,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was neceſſary and Eſſential to an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Law. But what inference can be drawn from hence to prove any <hi>perſonal Supremacy in the King,</hi> ſeparate and diſtinct from the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> I do not apprehend.</p>
            <p>But one Obſervation I cannot omit upon this Council, compar'd with that other held <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1175. <hi>&amp; Ann.</hi> 21. <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. For whereas in the former the <hi>Laity</hi> were preſent, as well as the <hi>Clergy,</hi> we find the <hi>King</hi> gave his <hi>Royal Aſſent</hi> to their <hi>Canons,</hi> and ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Laws, binding to the whole Nation; In the latter the Laity were not preſent, by any account that I can find of it, and therefore to make their <hi>Canons</hi> general Laws the Kings Aſſent would not have been ſufficient, nor was it <hi>ſingly</hi> had; for <hi>Gervaſ. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rob. Anno Dom.</hi> 1175. <hi>pag.</hi> 1429. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. tells us <hi>in hoc Concilio ad Emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Anglicanae Eccleſiae aſſenſu Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55049:131"/>Regis &amp; primorum Regni haec ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta promulgata ſunt Capitula.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Clergy</hi> in thoſe days, when they took upon them to hold Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods apart from the Laity, did not imagine that the King alone could give their <hi>Canons</hi> any Validity in Law, where they entrench'd upon or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer'd with the Laws of the Land, will appear by obſerving, that when in King <hi>Henry the Third</hi>'s Time the <hi>Clergy</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Gravamina Laicorum,</hi> had made many proviſional Articles for the enlarging their own Juriſdiction, <hi>pro quibus Epiſcopi Angliae fuerant pugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi, Mathew Paris</hi> ſays thus of them; <hi>viz. Formati ſunt Articuli circiter quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaginta, quos praelati in ſeripta redegerunt, ut apto tempore coram Rege &amp; magnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; praelatis lecti, effectum debitum ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirentur. Additamenta ad Math. Paris. pag.</hi> 199, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that it was the <hi>magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes &amp; praelati,</hi> as well as the King, and not the <hi>King</hi> without <hi>them,</hi> that could give life to them.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s ſixth particular is, That <hi>our Kings permitted no Biſhops to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate or inflict any Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure on any Baron or Officer,</hi> niſi praecepto ſuo; concerning which I have ſpoken already.</p>
            <pb n="255" facs="tcp:55049:131"/>
            <p>The ſeventh is, That <hi>they cauſed the Biſhops to appear in their Courts, to give an Account why they Excommunicated the Subject,</hi> This makes nothing for any <hi>perſonal Authority</hi> in the King. Whatever he does in his <hi>Courts,</hi> he does by his Judges, who have the Law of the Realm for their guide and Rule. And ought to keep all inferiour <hi>Courts</hi> within their Bounds; and therefore might and do yet every day grant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, when the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and their Officials proceed to <hi>Excommunicate,</hi> where the Law does not allow that Cenſure to be apply'd. And if the Writ of Prohibition be not obey'd, but that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> or other <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Judge</hi> proceeds notwithſtanding, an Attachment is the next proceſs. <hi>Vid. Fitz. Nat. Br. tit. prohibition.</hi> For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, whatever pretence of Divine Right the Clergy may have for their Juriſdiction, was always regulated by the Laws of the Realm, but never by the Kings Arbitrary Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>The Eighth is, <hi>That they cauſed ſuch as were impriſoned, after forty days ſtanding Excommunicate, to be free'd by Writ, without the aſſent of the prelate or
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55049:132"/>ſatisfaction giving; the King and his Judges communicating with them,</hi> tam in Divinis, quam profanis, <hi>and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding none to ſhun them, though by the ordinary denounced Excommunicate.</hi> Now the ground of this is no other, then the Writ <hi>de cautione admittenda,</hi> by which the Biſhops are commanded, <hi>quod accepta ab A. B.</hi> (the Perſon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate) <hi>cautione, ipſum à priſona, quâ occaſione praedict. detinetur, delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri mandent; alioqui quod noſtrum eſt in hac parte exequemur.</hi> To which <hi>Writ</hi> if the <hi>Biſhop</hi> did not yield Obedience, then a <hi>Writ</hi> went to the Sheriff to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Priſoner, if the Biſhop ſhould perſiſt in his refuſal to accept Caution. <hi>v. Regiſt. fol.</hi> 66. <hi>a. &amp; Fitz. Nat. Brev. Fol.</hi> 63. Now theſe <hi>Writs</hi> in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter were made in Parliament, as <hi>Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> tells us; <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Fol.</hi> 413. <hi>b. &amp; ſunt quidem brevia formata de certis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibus, &amp;</hi> [de communi conſilio totius Regni] <hi>conceſſa &amp; approbata;</hi> And therefore (ſays he, and the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> out of him, 2 <hi>Inſtit.</hi> 407.8. <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 48, 49.) <hi>nullatenus mutari poſſunt abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que conſenſu &amp; voluntate eorum.</hi> The Acts indeed by which moſt of the Writs in the Regiſter are appointed, are loſt,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55049:132"/>as all the Records of <hi>Parliament</hi> are before <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> but by <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> yet upon record many <hi>writs</hi> are directed, and the <hi>forms</hi> of them expreſs'd in the body of the <hi>Acts.</hi> So that <hi>Writs</hi> in the <hi>Regiſter</hi> are the very <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> they are <hi>Statute-Law,</hi> and the oldeſt <hi>Statute-Law</hi> we have. And conſequently the <hi>King</hi>'s command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Biſhops</hi> to diſcharge perſons, that were in priſon upon a <hi>Capias Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatum,</hi> and commanding the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff</hi> to deliver them in the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, is no Act of <hi>Perſonal</hi> Prerogative in them; But the ordinary courſe of the <hi>Law</hi> of the Realm, and warranted by <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> though, the Records of thoſe Acts being loſt, we now call it <hi>Common-Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s <hi>ninth</hi> Inſtance is, That <hi>our Kings ſuffer'd no Legates to come into</hi> England, <hi>without their leave.</hi> Of which has been diſcours'd already.</p>
            <p>The <hi>tenth</hi> is, That <hi>they determin'd Matters of Epiſcopacy</hi> Inconſulto Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Pontifice. Which is true, they did and had good Right to do, but not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſultis Magnatibus.</hi> Witneſs the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation of <hi>Stigand</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, temp. Willielmi primi.</hi> And
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55049:133"/>the intended deprivation of <hi>Wolſtan</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> The Controverſie betwixt King <hi>William Ruſus</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelm,</hi> about <hi>Anſelm</hi>'s going to fetch his <hi>Pall</hi> from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban:</hi> And that betwixt <hi>Lanfrank</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Profeſſion of <hi>Canonical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> which the former required of the Latter: the Chuſing <hi>Biſhops and Arch-Biſhops:</hi> the Controverſies betwixt King <hi>Henry the</hi> 2d. and <hi>Thomas Becket;</hi> all heard, debated and determined in <hi>General Aſſemblies</hi> of <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> and not by our <hi>Kings</hi> apart from their <hi>Great Councels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Eleventh</hi> is, That <hi>they permitted No appeals to Rome.</hi> 'Tis true; nor did they ever determine them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either <hi>in perſon</hi> or by <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> And therefore the Statute of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> which gives <hi>Appeals</hi> from the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Biſhop</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> was never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be to the King <hi>in perſon,</hi> but to the King <hi>in his Court.</hi> As we may ſee by what <hi>Ger. Dorobern. Anno</hi> 1176. <hi>Coll. p.</hi> 1433: And <hi>Hoveden, fol.</hi> 313, 314: tell us of the ſtatute made at <hi>Northampton</hi> in King <hi>Henry the ſecond</hi>'s time. Which both of them
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55049:133"/>call a renewing of the <hi>Aſſize of Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Now in theſe Laws made at <hi>Northampton</hi> there is this cloſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning <hi>Appeals; Juſticiae faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant quaerere per conſuetudinem terrae illos, qui à Regno receſſerunt, &amp; niſi redire vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luerint infrà terminum nominatum, &amp; ſtare ad Rectum</hi> [in Curià Domini Regis,] <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tlagentur.</hi> So that, though King <hi>Henry,</hi> as far as in him lay, had given ways to <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> (for when he was abſolv'd of the Guilt, that he was ſuppoſed to have contracted by having occaſioned the death of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> part of the ſatisfaction enjoyn'd him, was, <hi>quod licebit Appellationes libere fieri; Radulph: de Diceto. p.</hi> 560) yet the Kingdom afterward meeting in Parliament at <hi>Northampton,</hi> would not quit their intereſt; But renew'd the Laws of <hi>Clarendon</hi> againſt forein <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals;</hi> And explain the <hi>Appeals ad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem</hi> to be meant of <hi>Appeals ad Curiam Regis.</hi> But it is a common errour with Men, that are ignorant of our Laws, wherever they find they <hi>King</hi>'s name in any <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> or <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Proceedings,</hi> to imagine, that the <hi>King</hi> has ſome <hi>Perſonal</hi> Authority out of his <hi>Courts;</hi> But for the preſent, I will
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55049:134"/>give but one Inſtance, to detect that miſtake. The <hi>Stat. of Weſtm.</hi> 1. Enacts (<hi>cap.</hi> 15.) what perſons ſhall be <hi>reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable,</hi> and what not. Amongſt others, thoſe that are taken by [Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment le Roy] are appointed not to be bayl'd by that <hi>Statute.</hi> My Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in his Commentary upon that Law; 2d <hi>Inſtitut. pag.</hi> 186. ſays thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="margDblQuotes">1. The <hi>King,</hi> being a body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, cannot command but by matter of <hi>Record;</hi> for <hi>Rex praecipit</hi> and <hi>lex praecipit,</hi> are all one. For the <hi>King</hi> muſt command by matter of <hi>Record,</hi> according to <hi>Law.</hi> 2. When any <hi>Judicial Act</hi> is by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> referred to the <hi>King,</hi> it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be done in ſome <hi>Court</hi> of Juſtice, according to <hi>Law.</hi> The words of the Statute of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. are, <hi>ſi non, que il ſort per briefe, ou auter maundement del Roy.</hi> And yet, it was reſolved by all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> cannot do it by any Commandment, but by <hi>Writ,</hi> or by <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> of ſome of his <hi>Courts</hi> of Juſtice, where the Cauſe dependeth.

            <p>The Great Caſe in <hi>tertio Caroliprimi</hi> of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> turn'd upon this point. The <hi>Judges</hi> indeed betray'd the Nation in that cauſe, as they have done in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in theſe Hundred years laſt paſt, as far as in them lay: but how that Judgment was reſented in <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Reader may inform himſelf out of the 1ſt <hi>Vol. of Ruſhworth's Collections,</hi> and the 1ſt <hi>part of Doctor Nalſon.</hi> The Law was declared upon that occaſion to be, that <hi>Voluntas Regis eſt ſecundum legem et Juſticiarios ſuos, in Guriâ ſuâ &amp; non in Camerâ;</hi> according to 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Twelfth</hi> particular is, that <hi>Our Kings beſtowed Biſhopricks on ſuch as they liked: and tranſlated Biſhops from one See to another:</hi> concerning our <hi>Kings</hi> beſtowing <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> ſomething has been ſaid already. As for their <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating</hi> Biſhops from one See to another, I deſire to hear any one Inſtance in any age of any <hi>Biſhop tranſlated</hi> by the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55049:135"/>
               <hi>King, against his own will.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> pretended to ſuch a power, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Exerciſed it: and that was one of the miſchiefs, which occaſioned the making of the Statutes of <hi>Proviſors.</hi> But could never yet find, that any of our <hi>Kings</hi> attempted it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Thirteenth particular</hi> is, <hi>Erecting New Biſhopricks.</hi> The Inſtances given by Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> are 1ſt, the erecting of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Ely</hi> by King <hi>Henry the</hi> 1st, <hi>Anno</hi> 1009. taking it out of <hi>Lincoln</hi>-Dioceſs.

            </p>
            <p>In King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, <hi>ſix</hi> New Biſhopricks were erected by the King's Letters Patents; <hi>viz. Gloceſter, Briſtol, Cheſter, Peterborough, Oxford</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> But thoſe <hi>Letters Patents</hi> had the Authority of an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to warrant them, made in the <hi>One and thirtieth year</hi> of that King's Reign, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Be it Enacted by the Authority of this preſent Parliament, that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall have full power and Authority, from time to time, to declare and nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate by his Letters Patents,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Biſhops, ſuch number of Cities, Sees for Biſhops, Cathedral Churches and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55049:136"/>by metes and bounds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as to his moſt Excellent Wiſdom ſhall be thought neceſſary and convenient.

What became of it afterwards, I know not. It was brought in towards the End of the Seſſion, and did not paſs into a Law. But the bringing of it in ſhews, that the <hi>King</hi> was not conceived to have any ſuch Authority of <hi>Common Right.</hi> Nor did that King exerciſe any ſuch Authority. For the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> was in his Reign divided into two by Act of <hi>Parliament.</hi> And when it was reſtored to its former Eſtate in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> time, it was done by Act of <hi>Parliament.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55049:137"/>A Clauſe was inſerted into the Act of <hi>Repeal, That all Biſhopricks, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches, Hoſpitals, Colledges, Schools, and ſuch other Foundations then continuing, made by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or otherwiſe, according to the Order of the Laws of the Realm, ſince the ſchiſm, ſhould be confirmed and continued for ever.</hi> So that then the <hi>Biſhopricks,</hi> that had been newly Erected by King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Eighth,</hi> ſtood upon this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> A Confirmation <hi>by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> notwithſtanding the Repeal of 31 <hi>Henr.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.

            <p>So far were our <hi>Kings</hi> from aſſuming a Power to <hi>Erect</hi> and <hi>divide Biſhopricks</hi> at their pleaſure (as a <hi>late Author,</hi> in a Book intituled, <hi>A Vindication of the King's Sovereign Rights,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 12. takes upon him to affirm) That they never ſo much as divided <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> nor could make <hi>

And all the Biſhopricks in <hi>England,</hi> of whoſe firſt <hi>Foundations</hi> there is any particular Account given by our Hiſtorians, appear to have been Founded by Our Kings in <hi>Parliament,</hi> or by vertue of an Authority given by <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>

            <p>I ſuppoſe it will not be deny'd, but whenever any Biſhoprick in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar was <hi>Founded,</hi> at the ſame time it was endow'd.

            <p>Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s <hi>eighteenth</hi> and laſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, is an <hi>obſervation in</hi> Matth. Paris; <hi>where the Eccleſiaſticks having enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral caſes, in which they held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hardly dealt with, add, That in all of them if the Spiritual Judge proceeded contrary to the King's prohibition, he was attached, and appearing before the Juſtices, conſtrained to produce his proceedings, that they might determine to which Court the Cauſe belonged. By which,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it is manifeſt how the King's Courts had the ſuperintendency over the Eccleſiaſtick.</hi> This
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:55049:145"/>makes nothing for any <hi>Extrajudicial, Perſonal, Arbitrary</hi> power in the <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> matters, and is ſo far from impugning, that it corroborates my <hi>hypotheſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts</hi> often quarrel'd about their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and that the <hi>Clergy</hi> ſometimes made and attempted to put in execution <hi>Canons</hi> directly contrary to the <hi>Laws of the Realm,</hi> thereby endeavouring to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp and encroach upon many matters, which apparently belonged to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws,</hi> as, the tryal of Limits and Bounds of Pariſhes, the Right of Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the tryal of right of Tythes by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicavit,</hi> Writs to the Biſhop upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery in a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> the tryal of Titles to Church-Lands, concerning Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes and Attachments within their own Fees, and many other things which belonged to the <hi>King's Temporal Courts;</hi> That the <hi>Temporal</hi> Courts granted <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions</hi> in theſe and other like caſes; that the <hi>Clergy</hi> hereupon complain'd not to the <hi>King</hi> but to the <hi>Parliament, Ann.</hi> 51 <hi>H.</hi> 3. twice during the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. and afterwards <hi>nono Edw.</hi> 2. may be read at large in the Lord <hi>Coke's ſecond Inſtitutes,</hi> 599, 600, 601, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:55049:146"/>determined to which Court Cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, either in his Courts of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Juſtice, or, if the Clergy remain'd unſatisfied with the Opinions of the Judges, in his High Court of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But we need not wonder that ſuch a Prelate as Arch biſhop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> whoſe Divinity had taught him that <hi>the King may take what cauſes he ſhall pleaſe to determine, from the determination of the Judges, and determine them himſelf, and that ſuch Authority belonged to Kings by the Word of God in the Scripture,</hi> we need not wonder, I ſay, to find him in King <hi>James the Firſt</hi>'s time Exhibiting <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Abuſes in granting Prohibitions,</hi> againſt the <hi>Judges,</hi> to the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Privy Council;</hi> As if the Lords of the Privy Council had any Authority to direct the Judges in their adminiſtration of Juſtice, or to ſet bounds to the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of any Court. <hi>Vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 601, 602, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;</hi> 12 <hi>Co. p.</hi> 63, 64, 65.</p>
            <p>By what has been ſaid I hope it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſufficiently, that the <hi>Ancient Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction</hi> of our <hi>Kings</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical matters</hi> was ſuch a Juriſdiction, and no other than they had in <hi>Temporal matters, viz.</hi> in their <hi>Great Councels,</hi> and in their
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55049:146"/>Ordinary <hi>Courts of Juſtice:</hi> And that not only our Mercenary <hi>Doctor,</hi> but more learned and wiſer men than he, have unwarily confounded that <hi>Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> with a Fiction of their own brains, by which they have aſcribed to the King a <hi>Perſonal Supremacy,</hi> without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from <hi>Antiquity, Law,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>

               <q rend="margSglQuotes">That as in Temporal Cauſes, the King by the Mouth of the Judges in the Courts of Juſtice doth judge and determine the ſame by the Temporal Laws of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> ſo in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical and ſpiritual by his Eccleſiaſtical Judges according to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws
